# Changelog

## v1.12.8

- Fix a new terminal tab almost always opening in the wrong directory in workspaces that have accumulated many suspended tabs. A new tab inherits the most common working directory (and SSH setup) among its sibling tabs, but the tally counted *suspended* tabs too — and a suspended tab carries the stale directory it was last in. In a long-lived workspace where most suspended tabs sat in the same place, that majority always won, so every new tab opened there regardless of which tab you were actually on. The tally now counts only live tabs, so a new tab follows the tab you opened it from. Live SSH tabs also now contribute their real remote directory (from the shell prompt) instead of a stale or local-only path
- When "group active tabs" is enabled, resuming a suspended tab now moves it into the active group's order, not just visually. Previously a resumed tab jumped to the front of the tab bar on screen but kept its old stored position, so the visible order and the real order disagreed (and a drag would snap it back). The resumed tab now settles at the end of the active group — where it already appears — so dragging within your active tabs behaves predictably and the tabs you've most recently used stay together at the front, even after everything is suspended again

## v1.12.7

- Fix a hard freeze where the main window could become visible but completely unresponsive — no typing or clicking — after a display/monitor change (docking, undocking, or a monitor sleeping). Trackpad-scrolling over a full-screen terminal app (a TUI like `less`, `vim`, or a pager) while the terminal had been refit with a zero-height layout made xterm.js's scroll math divide by a zero row-height, producing an "infinite" scroll distance; it then built an unbounded escape-key string in a tight loop, pinning a CPU core at 100% and growing that window's renderer process to ~14 GB until it ran out of memory. Only the affected window's renderer was wedged — other windows and the backend kept working, which is also why the in-app diagnostics looked healthy (they sample the main process, not the per-window renderer). aiTerm now ignores wheel events on a terminal that hasn't been laid out yet, so the runaway can't start; normal scrolling and mouse-aware TUIs are unaffected

## v1.12.6

- Fix terminal rendering artifacts that showed up under heavy output from Claude Code: red diff-line backgrounds smearing across unrelated rows, and a staircase of half-typed or duplicated input (along with stray text from earlier) when typing while an agent was streaming. The v1.12.2 WebGL→Canvas switch fixed glyph ghosting, but the Canvas renderer turned out to ghost too under aiTerm's workload — the backend streams a full-viewport repaint (clear-screen + full content) ~60 times a second, and the GPU-backed backbuffer doesn't fully overwrite the previous frame, so stale cells linger until enough repaints accumulate. The underlying terminal grid was always correct; only the renderer was wrong, which is why the mess eventually cleared itself up. Switched the default to xterm's built-in DOM renderer, which replaces each cell outright and so can't ghost — aiTerm only ever renders a single bounded viewport (scrollback:0), so the GPU renderers' throughput advantage never applied here anyway
- Add a **Terminal → Rendering** preference to choose the renderer (DOM or Canvas). DOM is the new default; Canvas remains available for side-by-side comparison. Changing it applies immediately to visible terminals

## v1.12.5

- Fix the global "X agents working" footer dot doing nothing when clicked if the dominant agent lived in a *different* window. The dot rolled up Claude sessions globally, but Claude-hook events broadcast to every window — so each window's session map held agents from all windows, while click-to-cycle only searches the current window's tabs and silently fell through when the target lived elsewhere. Every window also showed the same global count instead of its own agents. The rollup is now scoped to the current window's tabs, so each window's dot is independent and every cycle target is reachable

## v1.12.4

- Fix Claude Code's IDE tools (notes, diagnostics, session tracking — the whole `aiterm` MCP toolset) silently breaking partway through a long session. aiTerm registers its MCP server in `~/.claude.json` at startup, but that file is co-owned by the `claude` CLI, which rewrites the whole file on its own events — a long-lived CLI session holding a stale in-memory copy could clobber aiTerm's entry, leaving Claude Code dialing a dead port for the rest of the session (MCP tool calls would hang, then error). aiTerm now re-asserts its entry on a 30s timer, so a clobber self-heals within one tick. The check is read-only and idempotent — it only rewrites the file when the entry has actually drifted, so there's no added disk churn. Also replaced a stale-tab-ID error that could bounce a session in circles between the dev and prod instances with a deterministic recovery path

## v1.12.3

- Make the global Claude-agent footer dot cycle through agents. When more than one agent is in the dominant state (e.g. "3 agents working"), clicking the dot used to always jump to the same representative tab. It now advances to the next matching agent on each click — anchored on the tab you're currently viewing and wrapping around — so repeated clicks walk through every agent. The tooltip gains a "(click to cycle)" hint when more than one is listed
- Fix the SSH MCP bridge being torn down when a terminal tab carrying a live PTY is moved between workspaces. Moving the tab preserves the PTY, but the bridge was being shut down anyway, breaking Claude Code's IDE integration on that session until reconnect
- Allow selecting and copying text in the rendered (preview) notes view — previously only the raw markdown editor allowed selection
- Trim trailing periods from detected file-path links so a path at the end of a sentence no longer swallows the period into the clickable link

## v1.12.2

- Fix terminal glyph ghosting — stale, overlapping glyphs that showed up on Claude Code spinners, diffs, and bold text. The cause was the xterm.js WebGL renderer compositing redrawn cells *over* the previous frame (its backbuffer is alpha-blended even though the terminal is opaque) instead of opaquely replacing them, so only redrawn cells ghosted and a refit cleared it. Switched the renderer from WebGL to Canvas, which clears each cell opaquely before drawing and so can't ghost — WebGL's scroll-perf advantage never applied here since aiTerm renders a single bounded viewport (scrollback:0). Falls back to xterm's built-in DOM renderer if the Canvas addon throws
- Replace the sidebar footer's renderer status dot with a global Claude-agent indicator that rolls up agent state across *all* workspaces: red pulse = needs permission, accent pulse = working, green = finished & unread, hollow ring = all seen, dim = no agents. Click it to jump to a representative agent tab
- Fix editor scroll-jump: a long file scrolled to the bottom via the scrollbar would jump back ~a screenful and drop the cursor on the wrong line when clicked. The browser's native "scroll the caret into view on focus" was yanking the viewport back to the old caret before CodeMirror mapped the click. Clicks now pre-focus the content with scrolling suppressed so the click maps to the correct line, and releasing the scrollbar without clicking restores the user's scroll position

## v1.12.1

- Fix recently-changed state being lost when you install an update. The auto-updater's "Install & Restart" relaunches the app by hard-killing the process, which skipped the normal shutdown save path — so anything not yet flushed to disk (most visibly a just-renamed tab, which would revert to its `%title`, plus scrollback and window geometry) was discarded. The updater now saves window geometry, scrollback, and workspace state before relaunching
- Fix tab renames living only in memory until some later save happened to flush them — renaming a tab now persists immediately

## v1.12.0

- Add a read/unread state to the Claude agent-done indicators. When an agent finishes, its tab shows a filled green dot (unread); once you view the tab it becomes a hollow green ring (seen). This is rolled up to the workspace sidebar too — the workspace dot stays a filled green dot until *every* finished agent in it has been seen, then goes hollow. Lets you tell at a glance which completed agents you still need to look at
- Add an hourly background check for app updates so a long-running window notices new releases without a restart. The check is silent (only surfaces the update banner/toast if one is found) and respects the "automatically check for updates" preference

## v1.11.0

- Add a workspace-level agent-state indicator to the sidebar, driven by Claude Code hooks (#2). The rolled-up workspace dot now mirrors the per-tab indicators — blue pulse while any agent is working, green once every agent in the workspace is done (waiting for input), and ❗ when an agent needs permission. Generic terminal output is demoted to a dim dot so a finished agent is no longer indistinguishable from any other line of output. Aggregation uses batch semantics (`permission > active > idle`): the dot only turns green when the whole workspace has settled, so green unambiguously means "done"
- Fix back/forward history navigation, and add a Window > Clear Back/Forward History menu item
- Fix `moveTabToWorkspace` ignoring grouped active tabs when choosing the new active tab after a move
- Fix the crash-marker warning log being dropped because it was emitted before the logger was initialized

## v1.10.8

- Drop the `/aiterm init` slash-command argument from the default Claude auto-resume command — recent Claude Code releases became unreliable about running the slash command on `--resume`, which is the dominant use case. The SessionStart hook (local and SSH) already tells Claude to call `initSession` on every new, resumed, forked, or compacted session, so the extra argument was redundant. Existing tabs with the old template form (including the legacy `claude --resume <interpolated-uuid> "/aiterm init"` variant from older releases) are auto-migrated to the new form on startup and on archived-tab restore

## v1.10.7

- Fix QuickOpen (double-Alt) trying to list files over SSH on a local terminal that had merely *used* ssh earlier in the session (e.g. Claude Code running ssh via its Bash tool). SSH-vs-local detection now reads the controlling tty's foreground process group (tpgid) and only reports ssh when the pgid leader at that pid is itself an ssh/mosh/autossh process — subprocesses inherit the foreground app's pgid but aren't what the user is interacting with. Side note: `sudo ssh host` and `bash -c "ssh host"` are no longer auto-detected (leader is sudo/bash, not ssh)
- Fix SSH MCP bridge slot leak when a tab is suspended: suspend kills the PTY but doesn't unmount TerminalPane, so `onDestroy` never fired and `disableBridge()` was being skipped — the shared `ssh -L` tunnel kept the suspended tab in its refcount

## v1.10.6

- Add post-crash forensics for WebKit renderer crashes: a running-marker file is refreshed each minute and cleared on graceful exit, so the next launch can detect that the previous run died uncleanly (`previous_run.crashed` + `marker_mtime_secs` in `getDiagnostics`)
- Scan `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` (and Retired/) for matching aiTerm and `com.apple.WebKit.WebContent` crash dumps from the last 30 days; surface process, exception type, and termination reason via `getDiagnostics.crash_reports`
- Capture unhandled webview errors and promise rejections to `aiterm.log` tagged `[WEBVIEW_ERROR]`, so JS errors that immediately precede a renderer crash are no longer silent
- Fix tab strip scroll position on workspace restore (active tab is now scrolled into view)

## v1.10.5

- Move scheduled backup timer from the webview to a Rust background task — backups now keep firing even if the main window's frontend hangs (which previously stopped the setInterval that drove them)
- Persist the diagnostics memory trend to disk (`aiterm-memory-trend.json`) and sample RSS every 60 seconds in the background, capped at 12 hours of history; the buffer is reseeded from disk on startup so post-mortem analysis after a freeze still has the RSS curve leading up to it
- Stop mutating the memory trend ring buffer as a side effect of `getDiagnostics` — reads are now pure and don't perturb the data being analyzed

## v1.10.4

- Guard state save against stale/zombie aiTerm processes overwriting newer data — disk mtime is checked before every save, and conflicting writes are preserved as `aiterm-state.conflict-<ms>.json` instead of clobbering the live state
- Skip the Cmd+W two-press confirm for editor and diff tabs (only terminal tabs require the second press)
- Expand getDiagnostics to expose JS heap, DOM node count, internal store map sizes, trigger engine buffers, and a per-event Tauri listener leak counter

## v1.10.3

- Send SSE keepalives on the MCP stream to prevent SSH idle disconnects (30s–3min drops)
