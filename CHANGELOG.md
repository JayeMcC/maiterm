# Changelog

## v1.10.6

- Add post-crash forensics for WebKit renderer crashes: a running-marker file is refreshed each minute and cleared on graceful exit, so the next launch can detect that the previous run died uncleanly (`previous_run.crashed` + `marker_mtime_secs` in `getDiagnostics`)
- Scan `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` (and Retired/) for matching aiTerm and `com.apple.WebKit.WebContent` crash dumps from the last 30 days; surface process, exception type, and termination reason via `getDiagnostics.crash_reports`
- Capture unhandled webview errors and promise rejections to `aiterm.log` tagged `[WEBVIEW_ERROR]`, so JS errors that immediately precede a renderer crash are no longer silent
- Fix tab strip scroll position on workspace restore (active tab is now scrolled into view)

## v1.10.5

- Move scheduled backup timer from the webview to a Rust background task — backups now keep firing even if the main window's frontend hangs (which previously stopped the setInterval that drove them)
- Persist the diagnostics memory trend to disk (`aiterm-memory-trend.json`) and sample RSS every 60 seconds in the background, capped at 12 hours of history; the buffer is reseeded from disk on startup so post-mortem analysis after a freeze still has the RSS curve leading up to it
- Stop mutating the memory trend ring buffer as a side effect of `getDiagnostics` — reads are now pure and don't perturb the data being analyzed

## v1.10.4

- Guard state save against stale/zombie aiTerm processes overwriting newer data — disk mtime is checked before every save, and conflicting writes are preserved as `aiterm-state.conflict-<ms>.json` instead of clobbering the live state
- Skip the Cmd+W two-press confirm for editor and diff tabs (only terminal tabs require the second press)
- Expand getDiagnostics to expose JS heap, DOM node count, internal store map sizes, trigger engine buffers, and a per-event Tauri listener leak counter

## v1.10.3

- Send SSE keepalives on the MCP stream to prevent SSH idle disconnects (30s–3min drops)
- Register MCP port in ~/.claude.json before setup() returns (fixes auto-resume race)
- Reset Term before feeding restored scrollback (fixes duplicated scrollback after restart)
- Preserve nav forward history when diverting mid-walk
- Make Cmd+W close hint more visible (centered card on dimmed/blurred backdrop)

## v1.10.2

- Require two presses for Cmd+W to close a tab (prevents accidental close with armed 2s overlay)
- Prune orphan scrollback rows from SQLite DB on startup, close_window, reset_window, and import_state
