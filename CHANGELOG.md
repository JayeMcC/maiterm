# Changelog

## v1.20.4

- **Fix secondary windows coming back empty or with stale scrollback after an update or restart.** Two fixes: a window whose active workspace had been suspended now un-suspends and respawns its tabs on load instead of returning blank, and an update relaunch now flushes *every* window's terminal scrollback before restarting — previously only the window you triggered the update from was saved, so other windows lost their buffers.
- Older "limbo" terminal tabs — ones whose PTY had ended without going through a normal suspend — are now normalized to suspended, so they show a proper "suspended Xd ago" age and are counted correctly in diagnostics instead of as uninitialized.

## v1.20.3

- **Fix an SSH host spamming `export AITERM_TAB_ID=…` into your shell on nearly every command.** When connecting to a remote host whose bridge setup was slow, the setup kept timing out and getting retried on every prompt — and each retry re-injected the tab-ID/port export into your live shell. Two root causes fixed: the environment variables are now injected only once per session, and the stale-lockfile cleanup that ran during setup no longer hangs for 30 seconds on a dead reverse-tunnel port (a leftover port that accepts a connection but never answers), which was what left the bridge stuck retrying in the first place.
- **Fix a release occasionally showing no notes in the "What's New" window.** A release whose notes were written as a plain paragraph instead of a bulleted list rendered as an empty entry. The window now reads both formats.

## v1.20.2

- **Fix mesh messages showing the wrong sender.** In a mesh workspace, every `⟦MESH⟧ "Message from …"` line was labeled with the *recipient's* own role name instead of the sender's — so a message from one agent arrived looking like it came from you. The envelope now derives the sender's identity from the sending tab, making a mislabel structurally impossible.

## v1.20.1

- **Fix the UI freezing after opening a mesh workspace.** The readiness modal polls every ambiguous tab once a second to see whether its agent is still alive, and each poll ran a full process scan on the main thread — with dozens of tabs the app beach-balled, and restarting re-triggered it. The probe now runs off the main thread and one process sweep answers the whole poll tick instead of one per tab.
- **Fix "Too many open files" once you pass roughly 68 open terminals.** macOS starts a GUI app with a 256-descriptor limit and each terminal costs three, so new terminals failed to spawn — usually surfacing as "MCP Bridge Failed". maiTerm now raises the limit at startup, before any terminal can spawn.
- **Agent hooks repair themselves instead of failing on every event.** If something rewrites `~/.claude/settings.json` — the `claude` CLI, or an overlapping deploy leaving the previous instance's port behind — every hook fired at a dead port (`ECONNREFUSED`) until the next restart, losing session tracking and the state indicators. maiTerm now notices hook entries pointing at ports that are no longer live and repairs them within 30 seconds, including a stale reverse tunnel left behind by another machine's SSH bridge.
- **Fix the SSH bridge breaking your own `ssh` to the same host.** With `ControlMaster auto` in your SSH config, the bridge's long-lived tunnel took ownership of the shared connection socket, so your own `ssh <host>` was forced to multiplex over it and failed with "Session open refused by peer". Every bridge connection is now fully independent of that socket.
- Fix "Install MCP for Current User" and "Inject maiTerm Env Vars" running against your local machine when the tab's SSH session had already exited — which clobbered your local Claude config with the remote's settings. Both now check that `ssh` is still in the foreground and tell you instead of writing.
- In maiLink, a remote or pruned agent tab that falls back to a live terminal snapshot now renders as a preformatted, badged block instead of collapsing into one long overflowing line.

## v1.20.0

- **Resuming a workspace brings back exactly the agents that were running.** Suspending a workspace now remembers which tabs had a live terminal; resuming it respawns and auto-resumes just those — so a 20-tab workspace that had 3 agents running comes back with those 3 live (with a progress modal for larger resumes), instead of waking tabs you never started or leaving live ones dead.
- **maiLink — companion app refinements.**
  - **Transcripts now show up for remote and Codex agents.** SSH-hosted Claude tabs — whose transcript lives on the remote host — and Codex tabs were rendering blank in the phone inbox; both now fall back to the live session so you see the conversation. Codex conversations distill per-turn from Codex's own session log, with the model name and a context-window gauge, matching how Claude tabs already worked.
  - **Questions from your agents are answerable again, with the right timing.** An AskUserQuestion now reliably rings on the phone and shows what's being asked, and its countdown reflects whether your Claude Code build actually expires the question (newer builds leave it open by default) — so a live question no longer looks expired, and a late answer to a question that already closed can't accidentally land on the next one.
  - **Permission cards show what you're approving.** A permission prompt now reads like `Bash(rm -rf ./dist) — approve?` instead of just the tool name, and approving a Codex prompt sends the keystroke that matches Codex's variable-length approval list, so your choice can't select the wrong option.
  - Attention alerts (the doorbell) fire only on a real transition into "needs you," so merely opening the app or restoring a session no longer pushes a phantom "finished," while an AskUserQuestion that opens without a permission prompt still rings.
  - Cleaner transcripts: agent-to-agent mesh and bridge messages are filtered out instead of flooding every participant's thread, a fan-out of subagents shows each one's task instead of a run of identical `Agent` chips, and an injected screenshot no longer leaves a duplicate raw-path bubble when you re-open the thread.

## v1.19.0

- **maiLink — reach your agents from your phone.** A companion app that connects **directly to maiTerm running on your own computer** so you can watch and steer your agents from anywhere in the house. It talks to maiTerm over your **LAN only**, on an encrypted, authenticated channel (TLS with a per-device paired token) — **no cloud service sits in the middle**. The one small exception is a content-free push "doorbell": when an agent needs you while the app is backgrounded, a tiny relay hosted on Cloudflare wakes the app, carrying no transcript or message content. To reach your agents from outside your network, set up a WireGuard VPN back to your LAN rather than exposing anything to the internet.
  - **Live transcripts, streamed per turn.** Each agent's conversation streams over a WebSocket as it happens, with a per-agent meta strip showing the model and a context-window gauge, and context compaction shown as a divider.
  - **Answer prompts from the phone.** An agent's AskUserQuestion arrives as a native prompt you can answer — single-select, multiSelect, and "Other" free-text all work — and you can respond to or interrupt a running agent. The inbox sorts by real per-tab activity, and answering a question clears its card immediately.
  - **Secure pairing you control.** Pair a device by scanning a QR code; paired devices are listed and individually revocable, each with its own token, so revoking one phone never touches the others. The relay is multi-tenant with capability auth — no shared secret.
  - **Send images to a local session.** Attach images to a message and they're injected straight into the local Claude Code session.
  - Designate which tabs and workspaces are reachable from maiLink — default-on with a per-tab exception — under a new Preferences section.
- **Full-session restore is now solid.** A tab's PTY is authoritative for whether it's actually live, fixed by a one-time boot reconcile and a sequential relaunch — so after a crash or update, tabs come back actually running instead of looking live but dead, and a mesh auto-recheck now waits until restore finishes before acting.
- **Mesh polish.** The three loop-control caps default to off, so a mesh never pauses a conversation unless you opt in. Long agent names wrap in the cockpit graph instead of overlapping. Agents report to you only through native AskUserQuestion — status-note scraping is gone — and an AskUserQuestion raises a deterministic "needs you" toast.
- **New tabs inherit where you were.** Opening a new tab adopts the previous tab's host and working directory (falling back to the suspended majority), so it lands where you were working instead of your home directory.
- Fix Claude chat history silently not persisting after a deploy or restart — a leaked `CLAUDE_CODE_*` environment marker made a resumed session write to a child transcript that was never saved. The markers are now scrubbed when a terminal spawns.
- Harden the SSH MCP bridge on a flaky remote: a bridge that fails is retried instead of wedging forever, and a hung tunnel fails fast and is reaped rather than hanging the connection.
- Fix workspace-note writes auto-opening the notes panel, and scope an agent's workspace-note operations to its own workspace.
- Run shutdown cleanup on a native (Cmd+Q or window-close) quit, not just a menu quit, so background work is torn down cleanly however you exit.

## v1.18.0

- **Mesh Workspace — connect a whole workspace of agents, not just two.** The Agent Bridge linked exactly two agents; a Mesh Workspace generalizes that to N:M. Turn on a workspace as a mesh and every named agent tab in it can message any other by role name, with no broadcast — each message is addressed, routed off a stable handle so a rename can never misroute, and an unknown or ambiguous recipient is a hard error with the roster, never a silent drop.
  - **Topics keep multi-agent conversations organized.** Messages group into topics owned by whoever starts them; a topic dedupes by normalized label, and only its owner — or you — can complete it. Completed topics reject further messages, so a thread can't quietly reopen.
  - **Loop control stops runaway ping-pong.** A soft per-topic turn cap pauses a back-and-forth at a checkpoint (a resume lifts it by another round), a hard ceiling is an absolute backstop a resume can't clear, and a time-to-live force-pauses a stale topic — so two agents left alone can't burn tokens or thrash terminals indefinitely.
  - **The cockpit drawer is your control surface.** Open it with Cmd+Shift+M or the MESH badge on a mesh workspace. It shows a live conversation graph (agents on a circle, topic "stars" weighted by turn count, a pulse on topics that just delivered), a topic list with human complete/resume controls, and a status board parsed from each agent's workspace note — a "NEEDS DECISION" block raises a deep-linked toast so you know exactly when to step in. Click any node to jump to that tab.
  - **Stage + filmstrip view.** Swap a mesh workspace's split tree for a focused two-panel stage with a live, scaled filmstrip of the other agents. Click a tile to bring an agent to the left panel, Shift+click for the right; an Exit button returns to the normal layout. Built on the existing portal rendering, so promoting and demoting agents never reflows or respawns a terminal.
  - **Pre-flight setup and readiness.** Enabling a mesh opens a readiness modal that inventories every tab — ready, not-yet-registered, suspended (with Wake), or unnamed (with inline rename) — so a mesh comes up with exactly the agents you intend. After a restart it auto-rechecks and offers to wake or re-init any agent that dropped, and agent purposes you set now persist across restarts.
- **Full-session restore on relaunch.** maiTerm now respawns and auto-resumes every workspace's active tab on launch — a crash, update, or quit-and-relaunch comes back as it was, not just the last-active workspace (new "Restore session" preference; the old last-active-only behavior is still available). A window reload reattaches to the still-running backend terminals instead of killing and respawning them, so reloading never loses live output. A workspace now looks active only when one of its tabs actually has a live terminal, so clicking around without resuming anything no longer makes everything look running.
- **Pin tabs to the front of the strip.** Pinned tabs cluster at the start of the tab bar and stay put — they're exempt from the active/suspended regrouping that shuffles other tabs around.
- **Smoother under load.** Terminal output is now coalesced to ~60fps with a guaranteed trailing frame, so several agents streaming at once — or hidden agent tabs in the same workspace — no longer saturate the renderer and bog down the whole app. A parked terminal still echoes a keystroke with zero added latency.
- Pasted screenshots are encoded as JPEG instead of lossless PNG, shrinking multi-megabyte clipboard images to a fraction of the size; images with transparency still use PNG to keep the alpha channel.
- Fix dropped files pasting a local path instead of uploading to an SSH or agent session on faster remote hosts — the drop now waits for the SSH probe before routing, so uploads work regardless of drag speed or host latency.
- Fix a production-only renderer crash when a workspace with splits churned its layout (add/remove/collapse a pane, or switch workspaces), which could crash-loop the renderer and make the UI appear frozen.
- Fix SSH file listing reporting a failure on remote directories that have no `.env` file (the common case).
- Fix Agent Bridge occasionally delivering a message ahead of older queued ones when a hold cleared between drain ticks — delivery is now strictly oldest-first.

## v1.17.1

- Fix agent prompts not submitting on large or multi-line pastes, image sends, and long agent-to-agent bridge replies. Claude Code and Codex collapse a big paste into a `[Pasted text #N]` / `[Image #N]` chip via async processing, and a submit keystroke arriving before that settled was swallowed — the prompt would stage in the input but never send. The composer and the Agent Bridge now share one paste→settle→submit sequence with a payload-scaled delay, so short typed lines still send instantly while large payloads wait just long enough.
- Add a search box to the archived-tabs dropdown, matching the hidden-tabs dropdown — an auto-focused field that filters archived tabs by name as you type.

## v1.17.0

- **Codex support — run OpenAI's Codex CLI as a first-class agent.** maiTerm's deep agent integration is no longer Claude-only. Codex now gets the same treatment: live state in the sidebar and footer (working / waiting / finished), tab activity indicators, auto-resume after a crash or relaunch, Agent Bridge pairing, and notifications — all driven through the same hooks pipeline that powers Claude Code. On SSH hosts, maiTerm installs and configures remote Codex over the bridge just as it does for Claude, and it works without a manual `/maiterm init` because the runtime is detected from the hook path. Codex integration is on by default; it only takes effect once you actually run Codex.
- **New "AI Agents" preferences section.** Agent settings are consolidated into one runtime-neutral section where you choose which agents — Claude Code, Codex — maiTerm integrates with locally and over SSH. Toggling an agent on or off installs or removes its integration immediately, no restart required. The Agent Bridge picker is now runtime-neutral, so you can pair any two supported agents.
- **Auto-resume is now runtime-aware.** The auto-resume modal preselects the right resume command for whichever agent is running and hides itself when the tab has no agent. The standalone "Auto-resume + Claude" setup-guide modal has been removed in favor of this.
- Fix wide emoji and CJK glyphs rendering as half-glyphs. The terminal now uses Unicode 11 character widths, so two-cell characters occupy the correct number of columns.
- Always surface `.env` files in Quick Open, with a clearer show/hide toggle.
- Context menus now clamp inside the window and scroll when taller than the available space, so items never spill off-screen.
- Fix the footer agent dots' click target collapsing to the size of the dot — the full indicator is clickable again.

## v1.16.1

- **Agent activity shows as three footer dots.** The sidebar's agent indicator was a single dot that only showed the highest-priority state, so a waiting agent could mask others that were still working or already finished. It's now up to three independent dots — working (blue), waiting (red), finished (green) — each clickable to cycle through every agent in that state. The sidebar is a touch wider (215px) to fit them while keeping workspace names readable; narrower saved widths snap up automatically.
- Fix bridged agents not receiving messages mid-task. Messages meant for a busy agent were held until it fully stopped, so a missed stop signal could wedge them indefinitely — while a permission prompt (the one moment we must not interrupt) was incorrectly treated as deliverable. Messages now arrive whether the agent is working or idle and are held only for a human prompt, matching how Claude Code captures mid-turn input.
- Fix the Agent Bridge breaking when a bridged tab was closed or reloaded. Closing a bridged tab left its partner pointing at a ghost, and Cmd+Shift+R reload orphaned the link entirely (one tab kept the ⇄ icon, the other lost it). Bridges now tear down cleanly on close and transfer across a reload, and a tab whose partner went away becomes immediately re-bridgeable without a restart.
- Fix composer sends not submitting when files or screenshots are attached. The submit keystroke was swallowed while Claude Code asynchronously loaded the attachment paths; it's now sent as a separate keystroke after a short settle window. Text-only sends are unchanged.
- Fix dropped or pasted files with spaces in their name not resolving to attachments in a Claude session that maiTerm hadn't yet recognized as Claude. Composer attachments now always send the literal file path, matching the terminal's own drag-and-drop convention.
- Fix Cmd+Shift+R reload of an SSH tab ignoring an auto-resume remote directory you'd explicitly set, reconnecting to the live session's current directory instead. A configured auto-resume SSH command and remote directory now take priority on reload.

## v1.16.0

- **Move tabs between panes without cloning.** Three new ways to rearrange your split layout — all move the existing tab (PTY intact, no respawn) instead of duplicating it. Drag a tab onto another pane's tab bar to drop it there; drag onto a pane's body to move into the center zone or create a new split on the edge you drop on (left, right, top, or bottom). For keyboard-first use, right-click any tab for "Move to New Split Right/Down" and per-pane move items — the first tab-level context menu in maiTerm.
- **Image viewer background switcher.** Transparent PNGs were invisible under dark themes. The image viewer toolbar now has a toggle that cycles Dark → Light → Checkerboard, so you can inspect transparency regardless of your active theme. The choice persists across sessions.
- **Resumed tab lands next to the tab you came from.** Unsuspending a tab from the tab strip or the hidden-tabs dropdown now places it right after the tab you were in, instead of at the end of the active group — so it's always one tab away when you switch back.
- Agent Bridge picker defaults to connecting an existing tab instead of creating a new one — the more common case when linking two already-running agents.
- Fix scrollback duplication where TUI apps (Claude Code, Ink-based CLIs) left permanent duplicate blocks in scrollback after a terminal resize. The PTY now coalesces rapid resize events and background tabs spawn at their saved size, so a width change never lands mid-stream.

## v1.15.0

- **Composer dock — write prompts like a human.** A per-tab, autogrowing multi-line input docked below the terminal, built for composing long prompts for Claude Code (or any CLI) without fighting the shell's single-line editing. Enter inserts newlines, Cmd+Enter sends, and Esc returns focus to the terminal. When the foreground app has bracketed paste on (Claude Code, zsh, modern readline) the whole block is sent as one literal paste that submits once; otherwise lines are sent raw. Drafts persist per tab across switches and restarts, and Cmd+Shift+C toggles the dock. It's on by default (configurable under Tabs)
- **Attach files and screenshots to a prompt as chips.** Paste a copied screenshot or Finder files, or drop files onto the open dock, and they appear as chips above the input instead of raw paths — with image thumbnails, dedup, and one-click removal. On send, the paths are appended to your text (raw for Claude sessions, shell-escaped for plain shells); for SSH sessions the files are uploaded to the remote host first and referenced by their remote path
- **Suspended tabs show their last session behind the resume overlay.** Instead of a blank panel, a suspended terminal now displays its previous scrollback behind a frosted-glass resume overlay, so you can see what the tab held before bringing it back
- **Edit Markdown table cells in place in notes.** In the rendered notes preview, click a table cell to edit it directly — Enter or blur commits, Esc cancels, and Tab/Shift+Tab move between cells. Only the edited cell's bytes are rewritten, so the rest of the document stays byte-identical
- **Cmd+G goes to a line number in the editor.** While the search panel is open Cmd+G stays find-next; otherwise it opens go-to-line

## v1.14.0

- **Restore on Relaunch is now on by default.** maiTerm reopens your terminal sessions and scrollback when you relaunch, so you pick up exactly where you left off. It switches on automatically once; if you'd previously turned it off — or turn it off now — that choice sticks and is never silently re-enabled
- **Agent Bridge picker is now searchable and sorted by recent activity.** When you create a bridge, candidate agents are listed most-recently-active first, with a search box to filter by tab name, workspace, or path — much faster when you have many agents running. It also tells you when an agent isn't listed yet (an agent only appears once it has registered with maiTerm, i.e. made a tool call or run `/maiterm init`). The terminal context-menu item is now "Create Agent Bridge…"
- Fix Agent Bridge dropping over and over between two agents on the same machine. Local agents connect over an HTTP transport that, without a per-session id, made them all share a single connection slot — so whichever agent acted most recently "owned" it and the others' tool calls landed on the wrong tab, which an agent reported as the bridge being dropped. Each agent now gets its own session id, so a bridge stays pointed at the right peer without having to re-run `/maiterm init`
- Fix two bridged agents deadlocking when one queued a message for the other mid-task. A queued message could sit undelivered when the recipient went idle waiting on the sender, leaving both agents stuck waiting on each other. Queued messages now drain as soon as the recipient is free, in both directions
- Fix the tab strip scrolling to the wrong place when you resume a suspended tab — it no longer snaps to the slot the tab held before it was promoted into the active group
- With "group active tabs" on, a tab now joins the active group on its first manual unsuspend instead of requiring a second one
- Internal: the MCP server Claude Code connects to is now keyed `maiterm` (was `aiterm`) in `~/.claude.json`, so the agent's tool list and status reflect the current name. Existing integrations keep working — the old key is migrated automatically

## v1.13.3

- **Search and per-tab age in the hidden-tabs menu.** The overflow menu for tabs that scroll out of view now has a search box to filter by name and shows how long each suspended terminal has been idle, matching the archive list. The popup is wider and taller so longer names fit
- **Clicking into a terminal, editor, or diff now focuses its pane.** Pane-targeted actions like Cmd+T (new tab) and Cmd+D (split) operate on the pane you last clicked into — not just the last pane whose header you clicked — so they go where you're actually working
- Fix Agent Bridge reporting a dropped bridge and misrouting messages when two or more agents are active at once. With multiple live agents, an unbound connection could be matched to the wrong agent's tab, making a bridged agent see its own tab as its partner. Tab resolution now only auto-recovers when it's unambiguous, and a bridge can never point at itself
- Fix a restored archived tab briefly landing next to the active tab and then jumping to the end of the active group a second later when "group active tabs" is on — the restored tab now keeps the position it was given
- Claude agents running in maiTerm now consistently refer to the app as "maiTerm"; the remaining "aiTerm" strings in the MCP tool descriptions and agent-facing messages have been updated. Your data, settings, and integrations are unaffected

## v1.13.2

- **New macOS 26 "Liquid Glass" app icon.** On macOS Tahoe (26), the dock and Finder icon now use Apple's adaptive Liquid Glass treatment — a periwinkle glass tile with the maiTerm "m" that the system renders for the light, dark, tinted, and clear appearances automatically. On earlier macOS, Windows, and Linux the existing icon is unchanged. The documentation site's logo and favicon now match the new icon as well

## v1.13.1

- **Install the recommended Claude Code status line with `/maiterm statusline`.** One command sets up a compact status line showing host · current directory · git branch · model · reasoning effort · context-used %, so you get the same at-a-glance Claude Code context line we use. It's idempotent (safe to re-run) and works both locally and on SSH-bridged hosts. `/maiterm init` is also faster now — it uses a targeted tool lookup instead of scanning every connected MCP server
- The "What's New" changelog modal now renders Markdown, so **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and links in release notes display formatted instead of showing their literal markup
- Fix Windows release downloads being published with an empty version in their filename (a double-dash `maiterm--windows-…`) — the version-detection step ran under PowerShell instead of bash, so it produced no version

## v1.13.0

- **aiTerm is now maiTerm.** New name, new look: a refreshed app icon and wordmark, theme-aware light/dark logos throughout the app, and a cleaner title bar that shows just the active workspace name with the maiTerm mark on the right. Your data carries over untouched — the app's underlying identifier is unchanged, so every workspace, tab, note, preference, and scrollback buffer is exactly where you left it, and the existing settings/state directories are reused as-is. No re-setup, no migration step
- The Claude Code slash command is now `/maiterm` instead of `/aiterm` (e.g. `/maiterm notes`, `/maiterm diag`, `/maiterm init`). The old `/aiterm` skill is removed automatically on first launch so you won't be left with a stale duplicate, and the underlying MCP server keeps its name — so Claude Code's IDE integration continues working without any reconnect or reconfiguration
- **Add Agent Bridge** — connect two running Claude agents in different panes so they can talk to each other directly. Link the active tab to another Claude session (Cmd+Shift+L, or the terminal context menu → "Link to Agent…"), and the agents exchange messages as real prompt turns in each other's panes, so you see the whole conversation and can interrupt with Esc at any time. Two modes: fork a session into a new split pane (an isolated peer that inherits the original's full context), or link two tabs that are already open. Each message is stamped with the sender's identity so an agent never mistakes a peer for you, links persist across an app restart, and a broken link self-heals after auto-resume
- Detect unexpected SSH disconnects: when a remote session drops, the tab keeps its title and shows a one-click reconnect instead of silently falling back to a local shell with no indication anything happened
- Add live upload progress with a cancel button when sending files to a remote host over SCP, replacing the previous silent wait with no feedback
- Add an overflow menu for tabs that scroll out of view, placed between the new-tab and notes buttons, so older tabs in a busy pane stay one click away
- Add an anonymous update-check counter (no personal data collected) so we can gauge how many installs are active
- Fix a file-descriptor leak on macOS where the editor's file watcher could gradually exhaust the process's available file descriptors over a long session, eventually causing failures opening files or spawning new shells
- Fix local editor tabs not refreshing when the underlying file was changed on disk by something outside the app

## v1.12.8

- Fix a new terminal tab almost always opening in the wrong directory in workspaces that have accumulated many suspended tabs. A new tab inherits the most common working directory (and SSH setup) among its sibling tabs, but the tally counted *suspended* tabs too — and a suspended tab carries the stale directory it was last in. In a long-lived workspace where most suspended tabs sat in the same place, that majority always won, so every new tab opened there regardless of which tab you were actually on. The tally now counts only live tabs, so a new tab follows the tab you opened it from. Live SSH tabs also now contribute their real remote directory (from the shell prompt) instead of a stale or local-only path
- When "group active tabs" is enabled, resuming a suspended tab now moves it into the active group's order, not just visually. Previously a resumed tab jumped to the front of the tab bar on screen but kept its old stored position, so the visible order and the real order disagreed (and a drag would snap it back). The resumed tab now settles at the end of the active group — where it already appears — so dragging within your active tabs behaves predictably and the tabs you've most recently used stay together at the front, even after everything is suspended again

## v1.12.7

- Fix a hard freeze where the main window could become visible but completely unresponsive — no typing or clicking — after a display/monitor change (docking, undocking, or a monitor sleeping). Trackpad-scrolling over a full-screen terminal app (a TUI like `less`, `vim`, or a pager) while the terminal had been refit with a zero-height layout made xterm.js's scroll math divide by a zero row-height, producing an "infinite" scroll distance; it then built an unbounded escape-key string in a tight loop, pinning a CPU core at 100% and growing that window's renderer process to ~14 GB until it ran out of memory. Only the affected window's renderer was wedged — other windows and the backend kept working, which is also why the in-app diagnostics looked healthy (they sample the main process, not the per-window renderer). aiTerm now ignores wheel events on a terminal that hasn't been laid out yet, so the runaway can't start; normal scrolling and mouse-aware TUIs are unaffected

## v1.12.6

- Fix terminal rendering artifacts that showed up under heavy output from Claude Code: red diff-line backgrounds smearing across unrelated rows, and a staircase of half-typed or duplicated input (along with stray text from earlier) when typing while an agent was streaming. The v1.12.2 WebGL→Canvas switch fixed glyph ghosting, but the Canvas renderer turned out to ghost too under aiTerm's workload — the backend streams a full-viewport repaint (clear-screen + full content) ~60 times a second, and the GPU-backed backbuffer doesn't fully overwrite the previous frame, so stale cells linger until enough repaints accumulate. The underlying terminal grid was always correct; only the renderer was wrong, which is why the mess eventually cleared itself up. Switched the default to xterm's built-in DOM renderer, which replaces each cell outright and so can't ghost — aiTerm only ever renders a single bounded viewport (scrollback:0), so the GPU renderers' throughput advantage never applied here anyway
- Add a **Terminal → Rendering** preference to choose the renderer (DOM or Canvas). DOM is the new default; Canvas remains available for side-by-side comparison. Changing it applies immediately to visible terminals

## v1.12.5

- Fix the global "X agents working" footer dot doing nothing when clicked if the dominant agent lived in a *different* window. The dot rolled up Claude sessions globally, but Claude-hook events broadcast to every window — so each window's session map held agents from all windows, while click-to-cycle only searches the current window's tabs and silently fell through when the target lived elsewhere. Every window also showed the same global count instead of its own agents. The rollup is now scoped to the current window's tabs, so each window's dot is independent and every cycle target is reachable

## v1.12.4

- Fix Claude Code's IDE tools (notes, diagnostics, session tracking — the whole `aiterm` MCP toolset) silently breaking partway through a long session. aiTerm registers its MCP server in `~/.claude.json` at startup, but that file is co-owned by the `claude` CLI, which rewrites the whole file on its own events — a long-lived CLI session holding a stale in-memory copy could clobber aiTerm's entry, leaving Claude Code dialing a dead port for the rest of the session (MCP tool calls would hang, then error). aiTerm now re-asserts its entry on a 30s timer, so a clobber self-heals within one tick. The check is read-only and idempotent — it only rewrites the file when the entry has actually drifted, so there's no added disk churn. Also replaced a stale-tab-ID error that could bounce a session in circles between the dev and prod instances with a deterministic recovery path

## v1.12.3

- Make the global Claude-agent footer dot cycle through agents. When more than one agent is in the dominant state (e.g. "3 agents working"), clicking the dot used to always jump to the same representative tab. It now advances to the next matching agent on each click — anchored on the tab you're currently viewing and wrapping around — so repeated clicks walk through every agent. The tooltip gains a "(click to cycle)" hint when more than one is listed
- Fix the SSH MCP bridge being torn down when a terminal tab carrying a live PTY is moved between workspaces. Moving the tab preserves the PTY, but the bridge was being shut down anyway, breaking Claude Code's IDE integration on that session until reconnect
- Allow selecting and copying text in the rendered (preview) notes view — previously only the raw markdown editor allowed selection
- Trim trailing periods from detected file-path links so a path at the end of a sentence no longer swallows the period into the clickable link

## v1.12.2

- Fix terminal glyph ghosting — stale, overlapping glyphs that showed up on Claude Code spinners, diffs, and bold text. The cause was the xterm.js WebGL renderer compositing redrawn cells *over* the previous frame (its backbuffer is alpha-blended even though the terminal is opaque) instead of opaquely replacing them, so only redrawn cells ghosted and a refit cleared it. Switched the renderer from WebGL to Canvas, which clears each cell opaquely before drawing and so can't ghost — WebGL's scroll-perf advantage never applied here since aiTerm renders a single bounded viewport (scrollback:0). Falls back to xterm's built-in DOM renderer if the Canvas addon throws
- Replace the sidebar footer's renderer status dot with a global Claude-agent indicator that rolls up agent state across *all* workspaces: red pulse = needs permission, accent pulse = working, green = finished & unread, hollow ring = all seen, dim = no agents. Click it to jump to a representative agent tab
- Fix editor scroll-jump: a long file scrolled to the bottom via the scrollbar would jump back ~a screenful and drop the cursor on the wrong line when clicked. The browser's native "scroll the caret into view on focus" was yanking the viewport back to the old caret before CodeMirror mapped the click. Clicks now pre-focus the content with scrolling suppressed so the click maps to the correct line, and releasing the scrollbar without clicking restores the user's scroll position

## v1.12.1

- Fix recently-changed state being lost when you install an update. The auto-updater's "Install & Restart" relaunches the app by hard-killing the process, which skipped the normal shutdown save path — so anything not yet flushed to disk (most visibly a just-renamed tab, which would revert to its `%title`, plus scrollback and window geometry) was discarded. The updater now saves window geometry, scrollback, and workspace state before relaunching
- Fix tab renames living only in memory until some later save happened to flush them — renaming a tab now persists immediately

## v1.12.0

- Add a read/unread state to the Claude agent-done indicators. When an agent finishes, its tab shows a filled green dot (unread); once you view the tab it becomes a hollow green ring (seen). This is rolled up to the workspace sidebar too — the workspace dot stays a filled green dot until *every* finished agent in it has been seen, then goes hollow. Lets you tell at a glance which completed agents you still need to look at
- Add an hourly background check for app updates so a long-running window notices new releases without a restart. The check is silent (only surfaces the update banner/toast if one is found) and respects the "automatically check for updates" preference

## v1.11.0

- Add a workspace-level agent-state indicator to the sidebar, driven by Claude Code hooks (#2). The rolled-up workspace dot now mirrors the per-tab indicators — blue pulse while any agent is working, green once every agent in the workspace is done (waiting for input), and ❗ when an agent needs permission. Generic terminal output is demoted to a dim dot so a finished agent is no longer indistinguishable from any other line of output. Aggregation uses batch semantics (`permission > active > idle`): the dot only turns green when the whole workspace has settled, so green unambiguously means "done"
- Fix back/forward history navigation, and add a Window > Clear Back/Forward History menu item
- Fix `moveTabToWorkspace` ignoring grouped active tabs when choosing the new active tab after a move
- Fix the crash-marker warning log being dropped because it was emitted before the logger was initialized

## v1.10.8

- Drop the `/aiterm init` slash-command argument from the default Claude auto-resume command — recent Claude Code releases became unreliable about running the slash command on `--resume`, which is the dominant use case. The SessionStart hook (local and SSH) already tells Claude to call `initSession` on every new, resumed, forked, or compacted session, so the extra argument was redundant. Existing tabs with the old template form (including the legacy `claude --resume <interpolated-uuid> "/aiterm init"` variant from older releases) are auto-migrated to the new form on startup and on archived-tab restore

## v1.10.7

- Fix QuickOpen (double-Alt) trying to list files over SSH on a local terminal that had merely *used* ssh earlier in the session (e.g. Claude Code running ssh via its Bash tool). SSH-vs-local detection now reads the controlling tty's foreground process group (tpgid) and only reports ssh when the pgid leader at that pid is itself an ssh/mosh/autossh process — subprocesses inherit the foreground app's pgid but aren't what the user is interacting with. Side note: `sudo ssh host` and `bash -c "ssh host"` are no longer auto-detected (leader is sudo/bash, not ssh)
- Fix SSH MCP bridge slot leak when a tab is suspended: suspend kills the PTY but doesn't unmount TerminalPane, so `onDestroy` never fired and `disableBridge()` was being skipped — the shared `ssh -L` tunnel kept the suspended tab in its refcount

## v1.10.6

- Add post-crash forensics for WebKit renderer crashes: a running-marker file is refreshed each minute and cleared on graceful exit, so the next launch can detect that the previous run died uncleanly (`previous_run.crashed` + `marker_mtime_secs` in `getDiagnostics`)
- Scan `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` (and Retired/) for matching aiTerm and `com.apple.WebKit.WebContent` crash dumps from the last 30 days; surface process, exception type, and termination reason via `getDiagnostics.crash_reports`
- Capture unhandled webview errors and promise rejections to `aiterm.log` tagged `[WEBVIEW_ERROR]`, so JS errors that immediately precede a renderer crash are no longer silent
- Fix tab strip scroll position on workspace restore (active tab is now scrolled into view)

## v1.10.5

- Move scheduled backup timer from the webview to a Rust background task — backups now keep firing even if the main window's frontend hangs (which previously stopped the setInterval that drove them)
- Persist the diagnostics memory trend to disk (`aiterm-memory-trend.json`) and sample RSS every 60 seconds in the background, capped at 12 hours of history; the buffer is reseeded from disk on startup so post-mortem analysis after a freeze still has the RSS curve leading up to it
- Stop mutating the memory trend ring buffer as a side effect of `getDiagnostics` — reads are now pure and don't perturb the data being analyzed

## v1.10.4

- Guard state save against stale/zombie aiTerm processes overwriting newer data — disk mtime is checked before every save, and conflicting writes are preserved as `aiterm-state.conflict-<ms>.json` instead of clobbering the live state
- Skip the Cmd+W two-press confirm for editor and diff tabs (only terminal tabs require the second press)
- Expand getDiagnostics to expose JS heap, DOM node count, internal store map sizes, trigger engine buffers, and a per-event Tauri listener leak counter

## v1.10.3

- Send SSE keepalives on the MCP stream to prevent SSH idle disconnects (30s–3min drops)
