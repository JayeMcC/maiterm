# maiLink — Mobile Companion Protocol & Architecture

> Status: **design / contract draft v0.3**. This is the shared contract between the
> maiTerm **desktop** side (this repo) and the **maiLink mobile app** (separate codebase,
> built collaboratively with the maiLink agent). Date: 2026-06-30.
>
> **v0.3 changelog** (agreed with the maiLink agent): the surface is now **topic-threaded**.
> Per-tab `/chats` is superseded by **`/threads`** (a thread is `kind:"topic"` for a mesh
> conversation or `kind:"solo"` for a lone agent tab); `thread_id` is the canonical key and
> `tabId` becomes a participant identity. Transcript turns carry `author` + `thread_id`;
> the WS `attention` event and doorbell context carry `thread_id` + `asked_by`. The pending
> ask is the agent's **native** human prompt — `AskUserQuestion` (structured) or a permission
> prompt — carried in `PendingPrompt` with a `respondable` flag (permission answers ship now;
> `AskUserQuestion` ships read-only first, answer-from-phone as a fast-follow). This kills the
> old agent-authored "status note / NEEDS DECISION" channel (desktop side, already removed):
> one ask in, one card rendered, one `/respond` out. Full contract + TS types in **§12**;
> it supersedes the chat-centric parts of §2.1, §4, §5, and §8. **Open product call (Darryl):**
> iOS-first vs iOS+Android launch scope (unchanged from v0.2; protocol supports both).
>
> **v0.2 changelog** (agreed with the maiLink agent): app stack is **Capacitor +
> SvelteKit + shadcn-svelte** (cross-platform, not native SwiftUI); `/push-register` is
> **platform-tagged** (APNs+FCM); the WS `attention` event carries an optional inline
> `prompt`; prompts have an opaque `prompt_id` carried through `/respond` (stale-guard);
> `POST /message`'s `msg_id` is guaranteed identical to its later WS echo; a transcript
> pagination param is reserved.

## 0. What maiLink is (and is not)

**maiLink is a lightweight mobile *companion* for the agents running inside maiTerm** —
not a terminal. When a Claude/Codex/Gemini agent in a maiTerm tab needs a human (a
permission prompt, a question, or it just finished and is waiting), maiLink rings your
phone; you read enough context to decide, and reply. And — because certain tabs/workspaces
can be designated **maiLink-native** — you can also *proactively* open one as a chat and
drive it from your phone, unprompted.

| | maiLink (this doc) | Full mobile maiTerm (`mobile-packaging.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| Product | Chat/approvals companion | Real remote terminal |
| Terminal core | **None** | `alacritty_terminal` + xterm.js + `russh` |
| Talks to | A running desktop maiTerm over LAN | Remote SSH hosts directly |
| Stack | Capacitor + SvelteKit + shadcn-svelte | Tauri mobile, ~80% reuse |
| Effort | Small, well-scoped | Weeks |

These are **independent** products. Don't conflate them. maiLink does not embed a terminal;
it renders a *distilled chat transcript* of an agent and injects replies back into it.

### Locked-in decisions (from product owner, 2026-06-27)

1. **Wake mechanism: thin doorbell.** The cloud is used *only* as a content-free bell
   (APNs for iOS). All real data — prompts, context, replies — flows over the **LAN /
   WireGuard** link. Apple/our relay never see terminal content.
2. **Platform: cross-platform via Capacitor (iOS + Android).** The contract is
   transport- and platform-neutral; push is platform-tagged (APNs + FCM). **Launch scope
   (iOS-first vs both-at-once) is an open product call for Darryl** — it does not affect
   the protocol.
3. **Interaction model: a chat app.** Bidirectional. Inbound = the agent needs/notifies
   you. Outbound = you can activate maiLink-native tabs and send proactive commands.
4. **Exposure: opt-in + per-device QR pairing.** The LAN listener is **off** until enabled
   in Preferences. Pairing is a QR scan that hands the phone host+port+cert-fingerprint+a
   one-time code. Each phone is a revocable device. **The existing localhost-only IDE/MCP
   server (`claude_code/server.rs`, bound to `127.0.0.1`) is untouched** — maiLink is a
   *separate*, explicitly-gated LAN surface.

**Three new things on the desktop side. Everything else already exists.**

1. **maiLink-native designation** — a flag on tabs/workspaces marking them as "exposed to
   maiLink as a chat."
2. **Gated LAN bridge** — a new `src-tauri/src/mailink/` module: its own TLS axum listener
   (separate from the localhost IDE/MCP server), per-device pairing + tokens, a WS live
   channel, and REST actions. Lists maiLink-native chats, streams their state, accepts
   messages/commands, serves distilled context.
3. **APNs doorbell** — when an attention event fires for a maiLink-native tab and no device
   currently holds a live foreground WS, the desktop POSTs a content-free wake to the push
   relay, which signs and forwards to APNs.

### What we reuse verbatim (already built — see `claude_code/CLAUDE.md`)

| Need | Existing mechanism | Location |
|---|---|---|
| "Agent needs a human" signal | hook state machine: `permission` / `idle`(done) / `active` | `src/lib/stores/agentState.svelte.ts`; `agent-hook-*` Tauri events |
| session → tab → pty resolution | `agent_sessions` → `tab_pty_map` → `pty_registry` | `src-tauri/src/state/app_state.rs` |
| Inject a reply/command | `write_pty(state, pty_id, &bytes)` + bracketed-paste submit | `pty/manager.rs:551`; `src/lib/utils/agentPrompt.ts:36` |
| Don't inject while a human prompt is pending | `deliverable()` / `isAwaitingHumanInput()` gate, FIFO mailbox | `src/lib/stores/agentDelivery.ts`; `src/lib/agents/adapter.ts` |
| Distilled context for the phone | `get_terminal_recent_text(pty_id, n)` (plain text) | `src-tauri/src/commands/terminal.rs:524` |
| HTTP/WS/SSE server patterns, auth, conn affinity | axum server | `src-tauri/src/claude_code/server.rs` |
| A deployed Cloudflare Worker (precedent for the relay) | update + stats worker | `update-worker/` (`updates.maiterm.dev`) |

The reply path is the **same rails the agent-to-agent bridge already uses** — maiLink is
"just another peer" that happens to be a phone instead of a forked Claude.

---

## 2. Data model additions

### 2.1 maiLink-native designation

Add an additive, `serde(default)` flag to `Tab` (`state/workspace.rs:215`) and `Workspace`
(`:406`):

```rust
// Tab
#[serde(default)]
pub mailink_native: bool,      // this tab appears as a chat in maiLink

// Workspace
#[serde(default)]
pub mailink_native: bool,      // all agent tabs in this workspace are maiLink chats
```

**Effective availability** is chosen by the `mailink_expose_all` preference
(`Preferences`, `serde(default = "default_true")` — *on* by default):

* **expose-all (default):** every *agent* tab is available, minus per-tab opt-outs.
  Availability = `tab.runtime.is_some() && !tab.mailink_excluded`. "Is an agent tab" keys off
  the **persisted** `Tab.runtime` (set once at initSession, never cleared) rather than a live
  `agent_sessions` entry — so a tab whose agent has *stopped* (network drop, quit) stays
  available and can be auto-resumed from the phone.
* **designate-only:** availability = `tab.mailink_native || workspace.mailink_native`. This is
  the opt-in escape hatch and honors plain shells the user hand-picks.

Both branches are intersected with `TabType::Terminal`. The single choke point is
`designated_tabs()` in `mailink/mod.rs`. Mirrors the `Workspace.bridge_all` mesh pattern (see
mesh-workspace.md): designation is *persisted*, the live roster is *derived*.

Flags (`Tab`): `mailink_native` (opt-in, designate-only mode) and `mailink_excluded`
(opt-out, expose-all mode). `Workspace.mailink_native` is the workspace-wide opt-in.

> **Serde round-trip pitfall** (project-wide): `skip_serializing_if`/`default` means loaded
> JS objects get `undefined`, not `false`. Normalize with `?? false` on the TS side; never
> `JSON.stringify`-compare.

Commands (follow the New-Tauri-Command checklist in root `CLAUDE.md`):
`set_tab_mailink_native(tab_id, on)`, `set_tab_mailink_excluded(tab_id, on)`,
`set_workspace_mailink_native(ws_id, on)`; `mailink_expose_all` rides the bulk `set_preferences`.

UI: a tab right-click toggle — "Make (un)available in maiLink" (targets `mailink_excluded` in
expose-all mode, `mailink_native` in designate-only mode) — plus a Preferences "maiLink" section
(enable bridge, "Make all tabs available in maiLink" toggle, paired devices).

### 2.2 Preferences additions (`Preferences`, `state/workspace.rs:793`)

```rust
#[serde(default)] pub mailink_enabled: bool,                 // master on/off for the LAN bridge
#[serde(default)] pub mailink_port: Option<u16>,             // None → pick + persist a free port
#[serde(default)] pub mailink_bind: MailinkBind,             // Lan (0.0.0.0) | specific iface
#[serde(default)] pub mailink_devices: Vec<MailinkDevice>,   // paired devices (see below)
```

### 2.3 Paired device record (persisted, in state — not preferences if it carries secrets)

```rust
pub struct MailinkDevice {
    pub id: String,            // uuid
    pub name: String,          // "Darryl's iPhone" (user-editable)
    pub token_hash: String,    // argon2/sha256 of the bearer token (never store raw)
    pub push_token: Option<String>,   // device's push token (APNs or FCM), set after pairing
    pub push_platform: PushPlatform,  // Apns | Fcm — which sender the relay uses
    pub push_env: PushEnv,            // Sandbox | Production (APNs); maps to project for FCM
    pub created_at: i64,
    pub last_seen_at: i64,   // any authenticated request or WS connect, throttled to one write
                             //   per 5 min. It DOES mean liveness — it previously advanced only
                             //   on pairing and push-token registration, so a phone talking to
                             //   the desktop all day could read as two days gone.
}
```

Revocation = remove the record; its bearer token stops validating immediately.

**Rejections are logged.** Every response ≥400 emits a WARN with method, path, status and who the
caller claimed to be — the device name if the token matches a paired device, otherwise a short hash
prefix and how many devices exist. Nothing is logged for successful requests (the phone polls every
couple of seconds). This exists because a rotated or expired token was otherwise *completely*
silent: the phone showed an empty inbox, the desktop log showed nothing at all, and that combination
is indistinguishable from "the desktop genuinely has no chats" — which is exactly the wrong
conclusion. A 401 in the log names the fix (re-pair) directly.

---

## 3. Pairing & auth

### 3.1 TLS on the LAN (required — and ATS-compatible)

The LAN listener serves **HTTPS with a self-signed cert** generated on first enable
(`rcgen` crate). This is non-negotiable: without TLS the WireGuard'd link is still cleartext
to anything on the same LAN, and mobile OSes won't trust an untrusted chain by default. We
satisfy this via **cert pinning**: the QR carries the cert's SHA-256 fingerprint; the app
pins it. Self-signed + pinned = encrypted *and* MITM-resistant, no CA needed.

> **Capacitor note (maiLink agent owns this):** in a Capacitor WebView, JS `fetch`/
> `WebSocket` cannot override trust for a self-signed cert (WKWebView / Android WebView
> reject it; `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` relaxes ATS but still won't trust an untrusted
> chain). So maiLink ships a **thin native transport plugin** owning REST + WS with
> pinned-fingerprint trust evaluation — iOS `URLSession` `didReceive` challenge +
> `URLSessionWebSocketTask`; Android OkHttp custom `TrustManager` + WebSocket. This is the
> app's responsibility and changes none of the desktop handlers; pinning is solved
> native-side on both platforms, not in JS.

**Fingerprint format (FROZEN — agreed with the maiLink agent, v0.2):** the QR `fp` field is

```
fp = "sha256/" + base64( SHA256( DER_of_leaf_cert ) )
```

- **Hashed input:** the server's **leaf certificate, full DER** — the whole cert, NOT the
  SPKI/public-key. These are the exact bytes `cert.der()` returns from `rcgen` on the desktop,
  `SecCertificateCopyData` on iOS, `X509Certificate.getEncoded()` on Android — so all three
  hash identical bytes. (Full-cert avoids the iOS SPKI ASN.1-header reconstruction footgun.)
- **Hash:** SHA-256. **Encoding:** standard Base64 (RFC 4648, `+`/`/`, `=`-padded) — **not**
  base64url. **Prefix:** literal `sha256/`.
- **Note:** here `sha256/` denotes a **full-cert (leaf DER) pin**, NOT OkHttp's SPKI
  `CertificatePinner` convention — the app uses a custom trust evaluator, so the prefix is
  just our shared label. Don't assume SPKI on either side.
- **Reproduction (both sides must print the same value):**
  `openssl x509 -in cert.pem -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64`

**Verification is fingerprint-only — hostname/SAN is intentionally bypassed.** With a pinned
self-signed cert, SAN/host matching is redundant and would only cause spurious failures (LAN
IP absent from SAN, or IP churn). Consequences, all intended: (1) the cert needs **no IP in
its SAN**; (2) the **same cert validates at any IP**, so a DHCP address change (or
mDNS-rediscovery) reconnects **without re-pairing**; (3) the pin changes **only** when the
desktop regenerates the cert — then the QR carries the new `fp` and the device re-pairs. One
native trust delegate covers **both** REST and WSS (iOS `URLSessionDelegate.didReceive`
serverTrust challenge; Android custom `X509TrustManager`) — REST and WSS share the anchor.

### 3.2 QR pairing handshake

```
QR payload (JSON, displayed by Prefs ▸ maiLink ▸ "Pair new device")
{ "v": 1,
  "host": "192.168.1.42",          // or the WireGuard peer IP
  "port": 9787,
  "fp": "sha256/BASE64CERTFP",     // cert fingerprint to pin
  "code": "RXT7-9K2Q",             // one-time pairing code, TTL ~120s, single use
  "name": "Darryl's MacBook" }
```

1. App scans QR, dials `https://host:port` pinning `fp`.
2. `POST /mailink/v1/pair  { code, device_name, app_info }`
   → desktop validates `code` (unexpired, unused) → mints a long-lived **bearer token**,
   stores `MailinkDevice{ token_hash, name }`, returns `{ device_id, token, server_name }`.
   The raw token is shown to the phone **once**; desktop keeps only its hash.
3. App stores `token` in the iOS Keychain. All later calls send
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` over the pinned-TLS channel.
4. App mints its **relay capability**: `POST {relay}/push-capability { push_token, platform }`
   → `{ cap }` (see §6). This is a one-time call to the *shared relay* (not the desktop), and
   `cap` is what authorizes the desktop to ring this device on the multi-tenant relay.
5. App registers for push with the desktop:
   `POST /mailink/v1/push-register { token, platform, env, cap }` where `platform` is `"apns"`
   or `"fcm"`. The desktop stores `cap` on the device record and presents it on every wake.

The pairing code is the only out-of-band secret and it's short-lived + single-use; the
bearer token never transits a QR or a screen after step 2.

> **WireGuard note:** maiLink imposes nothing on the VPN. When off-LAN, the user brings up
> their WireGuard tunnel (any client) and the QR/host simply carries the WG peer IP instead
> of the LAN IP. From maiLink's perspective it's the same TLS endpoint. We *document* a
> recommended WG setup; we don't ship a VPN.

---

## 4. The wire contract (LAN API)

Base: `https://{host}:{port}/mailink/v1`. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on
everything except `/pair`. JSON bodies. All times are unix ms.

### 4.1 REST (stateless actions)

| Method + path | Purpose | Body / returns |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /pair` | Redeem QR code → token | `{code,device_name}` → `{device_id,token,server_name}` |
| `POST /push-register` | Store push token + relay capability for doorbell | `{token,platform,env,cap}` → `{ok}` (`platform`: `"apns"`\|`"fcm"`; `cap` from §6 `/push-capability`) |
| `GET  /chats` | List maiLink-native chats + state | → `Chat[]` (see §4.3) |
| `GET  /chats/{tabId}?before={msg_id}&limit=N` | One chat + transcript (paging params reserved) | → `ChatDetail` |
| `GET  /chats/{tabId}/context?lines=N` | Distilled plain-text context | → `{text, truncated}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/message` | Send a message / proactive command (auto-wakes an unregistered tab first — §5) | `{text, submit?:true}` → `{status:"delivered", msg_id, woke:null\|"init"\|"resume"}` \| `{status:"unreachable", reason, detail}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/respond` | Answer a pending permission/question | `{choice, prompt_id}` (see §5) → `{ok}` \| `{ok:false, reason:"stale"}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/activate` | Activate/focus/resume a designated tab | `{}` → `{state}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/interrupt` | Send Esc (stop the agent); settles chat state to idle, clears the restored prompt | `{}` → `{ok, settled, composerCleared}` (may hold up to 3 s — §5) |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/shells/{shellId}/stop` | Terminate one background shell (SIGTERM→SIGKILL on its own pid) | `{}` → `{ok:true, stopped:bool}`; IDEMPOTENT — an already-dead or unknown shell is `ok:true, stopped:false`, never 404 |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/new` | Start a NEW conversation from this one (light clone: SSH host + cwd, fresh agent session) | `{}` → `{ok:true, tabId}`; `{ok:false, reason:"timeout"}` if the tab didn't appear in time |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/rename` | Set the tab title | `{title}` → `{ok, title}` (normalized) |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/resume-workspace` | Wake the suspended workspace that owns this tab | `{}` → `{ok, resumed, workspaceId?}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/wake` | Per-tab Initialize — re-register or restart this tab's agent | `{}` → `{ok:true, woke:"init"\|"resume"}` \| `{ok:true, woke:null, reason, detail?}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/queue/cancel` | Pull back the ONE message waiting in the input queue (§5) | `{}` → `{ok:true, cancelled:true, text, composerCleared}` \| `{ok:true, cancelled:false, reason}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/mesh-init` | Initialize-all for the mesh workspace that owns this tab | `{}` → `{ok, initiated, workspaceId?, reason?}` |
| `GET  /chats/archived` | Archived (recoverable) tabs across all workspaces | → `ArchivedChat[]` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/archive` | Archive a live tab (RECOVERABLE) | `{}` → `{ok}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/close` | End a live tab PERMANENTLY (destructive) | `{}` → `{ok}` |
| `POST /chats/{tabId}/restore` | Un-archive a tab back into its workspace | `{}` → `{ok, workspaceId?}` |
| `GET  /heartbeat` | Liveness + server clock | → `{ok, now, server_name}` |

### 4.2 WebSocket (live chat channel) — `GET /mailink/v1/ws` (upgrade)

Bidirectional, opened while the app is foreground. Server→client events:

```jsonc
{ "type": "chat_state", "tabId": "...", "state": "active|idle|permission",
  "runtime": "claude", "tool": "Bash", "detail": "rm -rf ./dist", "ts": 0 }
{ "type": "message", "tabId": "...", "role": "agent|user|system",
  "text": "...", "msg_id": "...", "ts": 0 }          // a new transcript turn
                                                     // for a user echo, msg_id === the id POST /message returned
{ "type": "attention", "tabId": "...", "kind": "permission|idle_done|question",
  "summary": "Needs permission: Run rm -rf ./dist",
  "prompt": { "prompt_id": "p_7f3a", "kind": "permission", "text": "Run: rm -rf ./dist",
              "options": ["Yes","Yes, don't ask again","No"] }, "ts": 0 }
                                                     // `prompt` mirrors pendingPrompt; present for permission/question,
                                                     // omitted for idle_done. Lets the app render decision buttons on the

```

Client→server frames are optional conveniences mirroring the REST actions (`message`,
`respond`, `activate`, `interrupt`) so the foreground app can avoid REST round-trips; both
paths converge on the same backend handlers.

Presence: while ≥1 device holds a live WS for a tab, that tab is "covered" and the doorbell
is **suppressed** (no redundant push). On WS close, coverage drops and future attention
events doorbell again.

**Clients MUST answer WebSocket Pings.** The desktop pings every 20s and closes the socket after
one unanswered ping. This is load-bearing rather than hygiene: coverage suppresses the doorbell, so
a socket that is dead-but-ESTABLISHED — an iOS app suspended in the background, a phone that walked
off the LAN — makes the desktop believe a phone is watching when nothing is. Worse than delaying
the push, it *loses* it: the doorbell records each attention transition as it observes it and skips
ringing while covered, so anything that happened during phantom coverage is never pushed even after
the socket finally errors out minutes later. Exactly the away-from-the-desk case maiLink exists for.
The first ping goes out **at connect**, not after an interval: a client is provably awake the
instant it completes a handshake, which is the only moment a pong is guaranteed to be answerable.
Ping-after-an-interval would routinely land in an app iOS had already suspended — open maiLink,
glance, pocket the phone — so "this client has never ponged" would be a race with suspension rather
than a fact about the client.

An unanswered ping always closes the socket; there is no "maybe this client can't pong" escape
hatch. A never-ponged connection is logged at WARN and closed anyway, because a reconnect loop is
loud and self-announcing while phantom coverage is silent and eats notifications. Verified against
both transports: iOS `URLSessionWebSocketTask` and Android OkHttp `RealWebSocket` answer at
framework level, with control frames never reaching app code.

## 5. Sending replies, commands & answering prompts

All outbound text rides the **existing injection rails** — the same `write_pty` +
bracketed-paste-then-`\r` path the agent bridge uses (`agentPrompt.ts:36`), behind the same
FIFO mailbox + `deliverable()` gate (`agentDelivery.ts`). maiLink never gets a privileged
shortcut; this guarantees it can't corrupt a TUI mid-prompt.

- **Free-text message / proactive command** (`POST .../message {text, submit:true}`):
  bracketed-paste `text`, settle, send `\r`. If the tab is busy/dormant it **queues** and
  flushes on the next `Stop`/re-init (same as bridge messages). Returns `queued|delivered`.
- **Image attachment** (`POST .../message {text?, images:[{data,ext}]}`): the desktop writes each
  image to a temp file named **`maiterm-mailink-<uuid>.<ext>`** (`mod.rs:974`, via `temp_dir()`)
  and injects the file path(s) followed by `text` on the same rails — the "raw-path inject". Claude
  Code does **not** reliably convert a programmatically-typed path into a native `[Image #N]` chip
  (that's a paste/drag heuristic in the interactive composer), so the path usually stays literal in
  the persisted user turn as `<path…> <caption>`. **The `maiterm-mailink-` filename stem is a shared
  cross-repo contract**: the desktop distiller strips a leading run of these paths from the echoed
  user turn (`transcript.rs` `strip_leading_image_refs`, keyed on that marker) so the persisted echo
  is the bare caption, and the app's `captionFromEcho` strips the same marker for its optimistic
  live bubble — so echo == caption on both the live send and thread re-open. A leading path is only
  stripped if it carries the marker, so ordinary messages that mention a path are untouched. **If the
  temp-file stem ever changes, both sides must change together.**
  **Body-size ceiling: 32 MiB** for `POST .../message` (`MAX_MESSAGE_BODY_BYTES`, `mod.rs`); every
  other route keeps axum's 2 MiB default. Over the ceiling the request is rejected by the extractor
  with **413** *before* the handler runs — so there is no server log line and nothing is injected.
  Budget phone-side by **total** bytes, not image count: per-image size varies far more than the
  6-image cap implies (JPEG photos ~<500 KB, but PNG screenshots have been seen at ~750 KB, and
  base64 inflates ~1.37× on top), so a 6-image batch runs ~3–6 MB and two heavy screenshots alone
  used to exceed the old limit. A 413 on this route means "images too large", not a transient error
  — don't retry it verbatim.
  **SSH tabs**: with a live bridge tunnel, the desktop stages the decoded bytes in the REMOTE
  host's `/tmp` (same `maiterm-mailink-<uuid>.<ext>` stem — the marker contract above holds
  unchanged for echo-stripping) by streaming them over the tunnel's mux socket, then types the
  remote paths; the send returns `delivered` exactly like a local tab, all-or-nothing (a failed
  transfer never types half a batch). `{status:"unsupported", reason:"unsupported_ssh"}` now means
  only "no usable bridge" (tunnel down/disabled, mosh) or "staging failed" — render it as the same
  in-app notice as before; a retry after the bridge reconnects can succeed.
- **Answer a permission/question** (`POST .../respond {choice, prompt_id}`): Claude's TUI
  answers permission with a numeric/selection keystroke (e.g. `1`=yes, `2`=yes+don't-ask,
  `3`/Esc=no). The desktop maps `choice` → the correct keystroke for that runtime and injects
  it **without** bracketed paste (it's a single keypress, not a paste). The
  `pendingPrompt.options` in `ChatDetail` are what the phone renders as buttons; the
  index/label maps server-side so the app never hard-codes TUI key bindings. **`prompt_id` is
  the stale-guard** (multi-phone safety): the server only injects if `prompt_id` matches the
  currently-open prompt, else returns `{ok:false, reason:"stale"}` — so a late-waking phone
  can't approve a prompt that's already been superseded/auto-resolved, and two phones can't
  double-answer. **This keystroke mapping is still the one fragile spot** (depends on the
  agent's current TUI affordance) — so the robust fallback is always available: just send a
  text message (e.g. literally typing "no, use the staging bucket instead").
- **Activate** (`POST .../activate`): for a dormant maiLink-native tab, run the existing
  auto-resume/spawn path (the same machinery clone/bridge use) and `switchTab` to focus it;
  return the resulting state. For a live tab it's a focus + presence no-op.
- **New conversation** (`POST .../new`): create a sibling tab that inherits ONLY where the source
  runs — its SSH command and cwd — and launches a FRESH agent session there (the runtime's bare
  launch command rides the existing auto-resume replay, so the tab comes up connected, in the
  right directory, with a live agent; `/maiterm init` needs no help because the SessionStart hook
  injects it). Explicitly NOT the duplicate path: duplication copies the session-id trigger
  variable — correct for reload and `/branch` forks, and exactly wrong here, since the copy would
  re-render the SAME conversation instead of starting one. Nothing else is inherited: no
  scrollback, notes, shell history, trigger variables or the source's own auto-resume command. The
  source tab is untouched and need not be idle. Works for SSH tabs (it's just another SSH spawn —
  no remote inspection needed). Tab creation happens in the owning window, so the endpoint waits
  for the new tab to exist and returns its id only once it's navigable; the roster picks it up on
  the next `chats_changed`.
- **Interrupt**: inject `\x1b` (Esc) — the documented "human interrupts the agent" gesture. A
  single Esc byte, nothing else — it interrupts a running turn, clears a half-typed line, and
  backs out of a TUI menu (including the resume startup menu), so the button is a safe always-on
  escape hatch regardless of the tab's believed state. `404` if the tab isn't maiLink-available;
  `409` if it has no live PTY (nothing to interrupt — resume it first). Returns
  `{ ok: true, settled: bool }`: **Claude Code does not fire its `Stop` hook on a user
  interrupt** (only on a normal turn completion), so the hook-driven chat state would otherwise
  latch at `active` ("Working") forever after an Esc. Because the interrupt is server-originated,
  the endpoint authoritatively settles the tab's running sessions to idle in the same in-memory
  state every reader consumes (WS + REST both converge on `idle` within a tick — no transient
  event to be clobbered by the poll floor). `settled` is `true` when a running turn was actually
  stopped, `false` when nothing was running. If the Esc didn't land and the agent keeps working,
  the next real tool-use hook flips the state back to `active`, so a spurious idle self-heals.
  **When `settled` is true the endpoint also clears the composer** (Ctrl+L = Claude Code's
  `chat:clearInput`): cancelling a running turn makes CC restore that turn's prompt into the
  composer for editing, and since message injection is a bracketed paste APPENDED to whatever the
  composer holds, the next message from the phone would otherwise land on the restored text and
  submit both as ONE concatenated prompt. Nothing is cleared when `settled` is false, so a Stop
  can't wipe a draft being typed at an idle desktop prompt.

  **The clear waits for the restore rather than assuming a delay.** It first waits for the Esc to
  produce output (that repaint *is* the restore), then for the output to stop, then clears —
  bounded at 3 s. A fixed 150 ms delay used to lose this race in the field: three phone sends,
  each followed by Stop, concatenated into a single prompt on a tab where `settled` was true and
  the clear had definitely fired. No output at all within the cap means nothing was cancelled, so
  the composer is left alone. `composerCleared: bool` reports what happened, which is what
  distinguishes "never cleared" from "cleared and it didn't take" in a merge report. Because it
  waits on a real signal, a Stop that cancels a heavy repaint can hold the response for up to 3 s.
  (This settles maiLink's own view; a *desktop keyboard* Esc bypasses this endpoint and would
  need PTY observation to detect — out of scope here.)
- **Rename** (`POST .../rename`): set the tab title. The title is trimmed and capped at 120
  chars; empty/whitespace-only is `400` (not a way to clear the name). Sets `custom_name` so the
  chosen title pins against later OSC/agent title overrides (same as a desktop rename), persists
  it (survives resume/restart), and updates the live desktop tab strip in every open window.
  Returns the normalized `title` actually stored. The label reaches other phones as a
  `chats_changed` on the next WS tick (≤1.5 s) — re-GET `/chats`.
- **Resume workspace** (`POST .../resume-workspace`): wake the *suspended* workspace that owns
  this tab. Tab-scoped so the phone never has to model workspace ids — the server resolves
  tab→workspace. A **suspended** workspace has its PTYs killed and tabs restore-on-demand, so a
  per-tab Initialize can't work — `/wake` returns `reason:"no-pty"` and `/message` returns `409`.
  The UI should therefore key off `workspaceSuspended`: when `true`, show **Resume workspace**
  instead of Initialize. This endpoint returns `{ ok, resumed }` —
  `resumed:false` (200) if the workspace was already awake (proceed to normal per-tab Initialize),
  `resumed:true` if a resume was kicked off. Suspend/resume is a frontend operation (PTY respawn +
  agent auto-resume live in the desktop app), so the backend signals the owning window to run it;
  it **respawns exactly the tabs that were live at suspend and re-inits their agents**, so after
  resume the tab is live on its own — no separate per-tab Initialize needed. The suspended→awake
  transition reaches every phone as a `chats_changed` (≤1.5 s) — re-GET `/chats` and the tabs now
  report their live state.
- **Wake / per-tab Initialize** (`POST .../wake`): the action to offer whenever a chat reports
  `registered:false`. It is also applied AUTOMATICALLY, with identical rules, ahead of every
  `POST .../message` — so a phone that just sends never has to think about registration.

  **Never send `/maiterm init` as a message to do this.** An unregistered tab is not merely
  untracked: if its agent has *exited*, the PTY is a bash prompt, and anything injected there is
  run as a shell command. The recovery affordance would be executing shell commands in the tab it
  was meant to recover. The remedy depends on whether the agent PROCESS is alive, which the phone
  can't see and shouldn't have to — so the desktop probes the process tree and picks:

  | tab state | remedy | `woke` |
  |---|---|---|
  | registered | none needed | `null` |
  | unregistered, agent alive (or a live ssh hop) | types `/maiterm init`, dialog-safe | `"init"` |
  | unregistered, agent gone, tab has auto-resume | replays the auto-resume | `"resume"` |

  Getting this wrong is destructive in both directions — a resume replay typed into a running
  agent injects junk and nests ssh — so a live agent always takes `init`, even when a resume
  command is also stored.

  **A registered tab is never touched**, which is the point: it may be mid-turn, and typing into
  a running turn is the one thing guaranteed to corrupt it.

  **It's synchronous, with a 45 s budget** (`WAKE_BUDGET_MS`). A local `claude --resume` is
  usually up inside 10 s; an ssh hop plus a remote agent boot can take 20–30 s. Design the UI for
  a long hold rather than a spinner that reads as hung. When the budget expires the wake keeps
  going, so a retry a few seconds later normally succeeds immediately — word `wake-timeout` as
  "still starting up, try again", not as a failure.

  Failures are `200` with a machine-readable `reason` plus a human `detail` (same shape as
  `unsupported` for images — never a "do it on the desktop" deferral):
  - `no-pty` — no live terminal. A **suspended workspace** lands here: resume it first.
  - `no-agent` — the agent exited and there is no auto-resume to restart it. On `/message` this
    means the text was NOT delivered, which is the fix: it would have gone to bash.
  - `wake-timeout` — the remedy was applied but nothing came up in time. Also not delivered.
  - `already-registered` — `/wake` only; nothing needed doing.

  If registration hasn't landed by the end of the budget but the agent process *is* up, a
  `/message` is delivered anyway (`woke` set) rather than lost — being unregistered was never a
  reason a paste couldn't land, and a runtime that doesn't register has no other signal.
- **Mesh Initialize-all** (`POST .../mesh-init`): bring the *Mesh Workspace* that owns this tab
  back to ready, typically after a maiTerm restart. Tab-scoped like resume-workspace (server
  resolves tab→workspace; the `mesh` field on `Chat` says when to offer it). Post-restart, mesh
  members usually show `state:"dormant"` even though their agent processes were auto-resumed —
  what they lost is their maiTerm *registration* (hook liveness + the MCP connection→tab binding
  that routes their outbound mesh sends), restored by `/maiterm init`. The desktop triages each
  member by a process probe: agent still running → types `/maiterm init` into its PTY
  (dialog-safe); agent exited → replays the tab's auto-resume; already-live members untouched.
  The phone does NOT need to distinguish these cases — one tap covers all members, and progress
  arrives as normal `chat_state` events (`dormant` → `active`/`idle`) as each agent re-registers
  (allow ~5–30 s per member; resume replays can take longer). Returns `{ ok, initiated }`:
  `initiated:false` with `reason:"not-mesh"` (workspace isn't a mesh) or
  `reason:"workspace-suspended"` (resume the workspace first — mesh-init needs live PTYs);
  `initiated:true` with `workspaceId` when the pass was kicked off. Per-member Initialize from
  the thread view is `POST .../wake` (above) — the same triage, scoped to one tab.
- **Cancel a queued message** (`POST .../queue/cancel`): pull a message back out of the input
  queue before the agent reaches it. **Offer it only when `queued` holds exactly one entry** — the
  endpoint enforces that too, and the reason is mechanical rather than cautious.

  Reading Claude Code 2.1.220: cursor-up in the chat input calls `popAllEditable`, which recalls
  the WHOLE queue into the composer as one blob. A per-message variant exists (`popEditableAt`,
  driven by a `queueEditIndex` the arrow keys move) but sits behind `CLAUDE_CODE_KB_COHESION_FIXES`,
  unset by default. So with two messages queued, one cursor-up recalls BOTH and clearing the
  composer would silently destroy the message the user didn't pick. With exactly one queued,
  "pop all" and "pop that one" are the same operation. `multiple-queued` (with `queuedCount`) is
  the refusal.

  **It verifies rather than assumes.** After the cursor-up it watches the transcript for the queue
  to actually empty (recalling writes a `popAll` op), and clears the composer only once it has.
  A recall that didn't happen returns `cancelled:false, reason:"not-recalled"` with the composer
  untouched — never a false success, and never a clear that could wipe something maiTerm didn't
  put there. Other refusals: `already-consumed` (the agent got there first — expected, since the
  affordance renders against a queue that keeps draining), `not-registered`, `unsupported_runtime`
  (Claude only). `409` if the tab has no live PTY.
- **Archive / Close / Restore** (tab lifecycle): two DISTINCT real operations, both reversible-ness
  labelled honestly:
  - **Archive** (`POST .../archive`) — RECOVERABLE. The tab leaves the workspace's live tabs into
    its archive; scrollback + restore context (cwd, ssh, auto-resume) are preserved. It drops from
    GET /chats and a `chats_changed` follows (≤1.5 s). Later restorable.
  - **Close** (`POST .../close`) — DESTRUCTIVE, NOT recoverable. The genuine end-conversation path
    (desktop Cmd+W): PTY killed, tab removed, scrollback deleted, any agent bridge torn down — no
    archive entry afterward. The phone MUST confirm before calling this.
  - **Restore** (`POST .../restore`) — reverses Archive. The `tabId` is an ARCHIVED tab (from GET
    /chats/archived), not a live one. Respawns the PTY + replays auto-resume; reappears in GET
    /chats on the next `chats_changed`. Returns the resolved `workspaceId`.
  All three are frontend-driven (serialize/kill/respawn PTYs), so — like resume-workspace — the
  backend emits to the owning window and returns `{ok}` immediately; the observable result arrives
  as the follow-up `chats_changed`. `404` if the tab id isn't a live maiLink tab (archive/close) or
  isn't an archived tab (restore). Archived tabs live outside GET /chats: enumerate them with **GET
  /chats/archived** (flat `ArchivedChat[]`, newest-first; group by `workspaceId` on the phone).

## 6. The doorbell (APNs/FCM) — the only internet egress

When an attention event fires (`permission`, or `idle`/done via the Stop hook, or a
question) for a maiLink-native tab **and** no paired device holds a live WS for it:

```
desktop ─POST {push_token, platform, env, cap, tab_id, kind, title}─► relay ─┬─APNs─► Apple  ─► iPhone
                                                                            └─FCM──► Google ─► Android
```
The relay fans out by `platform` (`apns`→JWT/APNs, `fcm`→HTTP-v1/FCM). Same content-light
payload either way; `cap` is the per-device capability (below).

- **Payload is content-light.** No prompt text, no terminal output, no cwd — only the tab
  `title` + `kind` (`permission`/`idle_done`), which is all the alert renders. Apple and the
  relay learn *that* an agent wants you and which tab, never the prompt. The phone wakes, opens
  the WS over LAN/WireGuard, and pulls the real content.
- `tab_id` drives `apns-collapse-id`/`thread-id` so repeated pings for one tab coalesce.
- `apns-priority: 10` + a time-sensitive alert for permission/question; an `active` alert for
  done/idle. Respect the phone's own mute.

> **The phone needs TWO routes at once — by design.** The doorbell splits across networks:
> the **wake path** (the phone registering its APNs/FCM token, the relay cap mint, and Apple/
> Google delivering the push) needs the **public internet**; the **content path** (the WS pull
> after the phone wakes) needs a route to the desktop (**LAN or WireGuard**). This is exactly
> the normal WireGuard topology — phone on cellular/WiFi for internet **and** the WG tunnel for
> the desktop — so it's not a constraint in practice. A phone on a **LAN-only AP with no
> internet uplink** is one degenerate case: it reaches the desktop fine, but APNs can never
> issue a token, so the chain stalls before any `/push-capability`/`/push-register`. Desktop
> symptom: the paired device's `last_seen` never advances and `push_token`/`push_cap` stay empty.
> Fix: give the phone a link with **both** internet and desktop reach.
>
> **Debugging note — that symptom is ambiguous.** "iOS `register()` called, but the plugin emits
> neither `registration` nor `registrationError`" looks identical for (a) no internet / APNs
> unreachable and (b) a **missing AppDelegate forwarding** of
> `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` / `didFailToRegister…` into the push plugin
> (the classic Capacitor gotcha — the stock template omits both methods). In the live bring-up it
> was (b), not the network. **Check the app's APNs wiring first** (faster to rule out), then the
> network path.

### 6.1 The relay is shared, multi-tenant infra — **the Flexmark-operated Cloudflare Worker**

maiLink ships as **one published app** (one bundle id, one Apple `.p8`, one FCM project), so
**one** relay serves **every** user — each phone just has its own per-device push token. The
project already operates a Cloudflare Worker (`update-worker/`, `updates.maiterm.dev`); it gains
`POST /push` + `POST /push-capability`, holding the `.p8`/FCM key that can't live safely on
clients. The desktop's built-in default relay URL points here; `Preferences.mailink_relay_url`
is only an optional self-host override.

**Why there is no shared relay key.** Because the relay is multi-tenant, it can't authenticate
desktops with one secret (it would have to ship in every install → extractable → open spam
proxy). Instead the relay holds a server-side `CAP_SECRET` and each phone mints a **capability**:

```
phone ─POST /push-capability {push_token, platform}─► relay ─► {cap = base64url(HMAC-SHA256(CAP_SECRET, "platform:push_token"))}
```

The phone hands `cap` to the desktops it pairs with (via `/push-register`, over the pinned-TLS
LAN channel). The desktop presents `cap` on every `/push`; the relay recomputes the HMAC and
rejects a mismatch (`403`). Properties: `CAP_SECRET` never leaves the relay; a desktop can't
forge a cap for a token it never received from a real phone; rotating `CAP_SECRET` revokes every
cap at once; the relay stays **stateless** (no DB). Possessing the push token is the underlying
gate (tokens are app-private and only ever travel APNs→phone→pinned-TLS→paired desktop).

Relay endpoints (in `update-worker/`):
- `POST /push-capability` — `{push_token, platform}` → `{cap}`. Open mint (rate-limit later).
- `POST /push` — `{push_token, platform, env, cap, tab_id, kind, title}`. `403` on a bad cap,
  `503` if `CAP_SECRET` unset, else echoes the upstream APNs/FCM verdict.
- gateway-by-`env`: only `env:"production"`→`api.push.apple.com`, else the sandbox gateway.

## 7. Security & threat model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Anyone on the LAN hitting the bridge | Bridge is **off by default**; bearer token required; pairing needs the one-time QR code |
| Eavesdropping / MITM on LAN | TLS (self-signed) + **cert pinning** via QR fingerprint |
| Stolen/lost phone | Revoke the device in Prefs → token hash deleted → instant lockout; tokens are per-device |
| Token theft from disk | Token stored hashed server-side; on the phone it lives in the iOS Keychain |
| Replay / pairing-code reuse | Pairing code is single-use + ~120 s TTL |
| Doorbell abuse / data leak via cloud | Relay payload is content-free; relay is stateless; `.p8` never on clients |
| Exposing plain shells / non-agent tabs | Only *agent* tabs (with a detected `runtime`) are ever available; plain shells are never auto-exposed. In designate-only mode the user may still hand-pick a shell via `mailink_native` |
| Reaching a held-back tab by known tab_id | Every tab-scoped endpoint — `context`, `message`, `respond`, `interrupt` (not just list/stream/doorbell) — passes through `is_designated()` and returns `404` for a non-available tab. "Make unavailable in maiLink" is a real gate, not just a visibility toggle |
| Cross-contaminating the IDE/MCP server | maiLink is a **separate listener**; `claude_code/server.rs` stays bound to `127.0.0.1` |
| Injection corrupting a TUI mid-prompt | Same FIFO + `deliverable()`/`isAwaitingHumanInput()` gate as the agent bridge |

Off-LAN access is the user's **WireGuard** tunnel — we never expose the bridge to the public
internet directly, and we don't ship a VPN. The QR simply carries the WG peer IP when remote.

---

## 8. Discovery

QR carries host+port, so zero-config discovery is optional. A nicety for later: advertise
`_mailink._tcp` via mDNS/Bonjour so a paired phone re-finds the desktop after a DHCP IP
change without re-pairing (the cert+token stay valid; only the address moves). Not needed
for v1 (QR re-scan covers it).

---

## 9. Build plan (desktop side)

Phased so each lands independently and is testable without the phone:

- **P0 — Contract lock.** This doc, reviewed by product owner + maiLink agent. ← *we are here.*
- **P1 — Designation + Prefs.** `mailink_native` on Tab/Workspace, the two set-commands, the
  master enable + device list in Preferences, the context-menu/workspace toggles. No
  networking yet. Verifiable purely in the desktop app.
- **P2 — `mailink` module + pairing.** New `src-tauri/src/mailink/`: gated TLS axum listener
  (rcgen self-signed), `/pair`, bearer-token store, `/chats`, `/chats/{id}` + `/context`.
  Test with `curl --cacert`/pinning from a laptop. No push, no WS yet.
- **P3 — WS live channel + actions.** `/ws`, `/message`, `/respond`, `/activate`,
  `/interrupt`, presence/coverage suppression. This is the full chat loop over LAN with the
  app foregrounded.
- **P4 — Doorbell.** Relay route on the Cloudflare Worker + desktop trigger on attention
  events when uncovered + `/push-register`. End-to-end background wake.
- **P5 — Hardening.** Revocation UX, reconnect/backoff, rate-limits, mDNS, Android/FCM
  transport behind the same contract.

P1 is a safe, self-contained first commit. P2+ should land in lockstep with the maiLink app
so the contract is exercised, not just asserted.

---

## 10. Open questions

**For the product owner:**
- [ ] **Launch scope** — iOS-first, or iOS+Android at launch? The maiLink agent is building
      cross-platform (Capacitor), and the protocol supports both; this is purely a
      go-to-market/effort call, not a technical one.
- [ ] **Push key hosting** — confirm **(A) reuse the Cloudflare Worker as a stateless push
      relay** (recommended) vs (B) embed keys vs (C) per-install team key. Note: now hosts
      BOTH the APNs `.p8` and an FCM service-account key (Capacitor → both platforms). (§6.1)
- [ ] **"Activate" semantics** — does activating a dormant maiLink-native tab mean (i)
      resume an existing agent session, (ii) start a fresh agent, or (iii) just focus it if
      already running? (Likely "resume if it has a session, else start" — confirm.)
- [ ] **Transcript fidelity** — is "distilled recent plain-text + structured attention
      events" enough for the chat view in v1, or do you want a cleaner turn-by-turn
      transcript (would need parsing agent output into messages)?
- [ ] **Multiple phones** — expected (you + staff)? Affects presence/coverage and whether a
      reply from phone A should echo to phone B's thread. (Contract already supports N
      devices; just confirm the UX expectation.)

**For the maiLink agent — RESOLVED (v0.2):**
- [x] Stack = **Capacitor + SvelteKit + shadcn-svelte** (cross-platform).
- [x] Cert pinning = **native transport plugin** (iOS URLSession challenge + Android OkHttp
      TrustManager), not JS — owns REST + WS with pinned-fingerprint trust. (§3.1)
- [x] JSON shapes in §4 **agreed** (the v0.2 deltas above are the agreed deltas).
- [ ] Bundle-id + APNs `.p8` + FCM service-account ownership → handed to the relay after
      Darryl signs off on hosting (§6.1).

## 11. Status of the desktop implementation

- **P1 — DONE** (`fe95aff`): `mailink_native` on Tab/Workspace + `mailink_enabled` pref,
  set-commands, TS/store wiring, tab "Expose to maiLink" toggle, Preferences section.
- **P2a — DONE** (`1fde520`): `src-tauri/src/mailink/` gated TLS listener (rcgen self-signed,
  persisted, SAN-agnostic), `/heartbeat`, fingerprint pipeline (unit-tested vs `openssl`).
- **P2b — DONE** (`96f49d9`): dev bearer token + `GET /chats`, `/chats/{tabId}`,
  `/chats/{tabId}/context` derived from live `agent_sessions` state. Compiles + unit tests pass.
- **P3 — DONE** (`6da933a`): write path (`POST /message`, `/respond` with prompt_id
  stale-guard, `/interrupt`) + live WS event stream (`GET /ws`).
- **P4a — DONE** (`533ed1f`): production pairing — `POST /pair` (one-time code → per-device
  bearer token, stored hashed/revocable) + `POST /push-register`; auth widened to dev-token
  OR device token; `mailink_create_pairing` command → QR payload. Verified live.
- **🏁 INTEGRATION PASS — PROVEN END-TO-END (this session)** with the maiLink Capacitor app on
  an iOS simulator over pinned self-signed TLS, against a live Claude agent:
  - on-device cert pin validated; `GET /chats`/thread/`context` pulled live;
  - live state (dormant→active→idle) rendered in-app; attention → "Needs you" + pendingPrompt;
  - **write round-trip**: the phone's `POST /respond {choice:"No"}` denied a real Claude
    `Bash(rm …)` — keystroke landed in the agent's TUI; `POST /message` proactive command
    delivered and the agent acted on it;
  - `/pair`→device-token, `/push-register`, WS frames, auth, `fp`==openssl all verified.
- **P4b desktop — DONE** (`9e927f5`): the doorbell **trigger** — a global ~2s loop that, on a
  maiLink-native tab entering attention (permission/idle-done) with no phone WS-covered, POSTs a
  content-free `{push_token, platform, env, tab_id, kind, title}` wake to the relay per paired
  device. Coverage via `AppState.mailink_ws_count`; relay from `Preferences.mailink_relay_url`
  /`_key`. No-op until a relay URL is configured. Relay hosting confirmed: **reuse the existing
  Cloudflare update-worker** (`updates.maiterm.dev`) `/push` route.
- **Doorbell relay `/push` — DONE** (`c35c0eb`, in `update-worker/`): the Cloudflare worker
  `POST /push` route. Fans out — APNs (ES256 JWT minted from the `.p8`, **gateway-by-`env`**:
  only `production`→`api.push.apple.com`, else sandbox) / FCM (HTTP-v1, OAuth2 from the
  service-account JWT). JWTs cached in the isolate global. Response echoes the upstream APNs/FCM
  verdict for desktop logs.
- **Multi-tenant capability auth — DONE** (`641c947` relay, `c27ac0c` desktop): the relay is
  **shared infra for every user of the one published app**, so the per-user `MAILINK_RELAY_KEY`
  is gone. Added `POST /push-capability` (`{push_token,platform}`→`{cap}`, `cap =
  HMAC(CAP_SECRET, platform:push_token)`); `/push` now requires `cap` (403 on mismatch).
  Desktop: `MailinkDevice.push_cap`, `/push-register` accepts `cap`, the doorbell only rings
  devices with BOTH a token and a cap, the relay URL is **baked in by default**
  (`mailink_relay_url` is an optional self-host override), and the Prefs key field is removed.
  Also fixed `set_preferences` to preserve backend-owned `mailink_devices`.
- **Relay deployed + smoke-passed — DONE** (2026-06-28, worker version `edddb56b`): secrets set
  (`CAP_SECRET`, `APNS_KEY_P8`, `APNS_KEY_ID`=`DRWCHZ5M5B`, `APNS_TEAM_ID`=`7HJJ4SQ4TC`,
  `APNS_TOPIC`=`dev.maiterm.mailink`) and `wrangler deploy` shipped. Smoke: mint→`{cap}`; ring a
  fake token with a valid cap → Apple `400 BadDeviceToken` (JWT + sandbox gateway + Workers→APNs
  **HTTP/2** all confirmed working); wrong cap → `403`; `/latest.json` → `200` (update service
  unaffected).
- **🏁 DOORBELL FINALE — PROVEN END-TO-END ON REAL HARDWARE** (2026-06-28, iPhone, locked): a real
  Claude permission on a maiLink-native tab → the ~2s doorbell loop → relay `/push` (HMAC cap
  verified) → APNs sandbox **`200 OK`** → dPhone **lock-screen alert** → tap → deep-link
  `/chat/{tabId}` → WS reconnect over pinned LAN → live prompt rendered → **the human Approved from
  the phone** → `/respond` injected the choice → the real Claude agent executed the command. The
  whole reason-for-being works: agent needs you while you're away → your phone rings → you answer
  from the lock screen → the agent moves. (Bug chain cleared en route: a missing iOS AppDelegate
  APNs-forwarding method blocked token issuance — classic Capacitor gotcha, peer-side fix.)
- **Post-proof, app-side polish (peer):** strip push-debug breadcrumbs; notifications pre-prompt;
  gate initPush on transport-bootstrap (kill the mock-race); prod signing = flip
  `aps-environment`/registerPush `env` to "production" (relay routes by `env`, **no relay change**).
- **Post-proof, desktop/relay (mine):** fold the desktop capability code into a normal maiTerm
  **release** (the dev instance has it; shipped app doesn't — relay deploy is independent). **Android:**
  the relay's FCM `/push` leg is coded+deployed; needs Darryl to provision a Firebase project →
  `wrangler secret put FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` → run the same finale with `platform:"fcm"`.
- **Pairing & device-management UI — DONE**: Preferences ▸ AI Agents ▸ maiLink now has a real
  **"Pair a phone"** button → a QR modal (renders the `mailink_create_pairing` payload via
  `qrcode-generator`, shows the code + host:port + a 120s expiry countdown with regenerate), plus a
  **Paired devices** list (name, platform/env, doorbell-ready badge, paired/last-seen) with inline
  **Revoke**. New backend commands `mailink_list_devices` (sanitized — no token hash/cap) and
  `mailink_remove_device` (idempotent; drops the record so the bearer stops working and the doorbell
  stops ringing it). Closes the last P5 "Revocation UX" gap and replaces the deferred-UI stub.
- **Per-turn source-markdown distillation — DONE** (`6ce7232`): `ChatDetail.transcript` is now real
  per-turn turns read from Claude's session JSONL (`~/.claude/projects/*/<session_id>.jsonl`, by the
  unique session id — no hook change), not the `recent_text()` terminal scrape. assistant `text`→
  `role:"agent"` (source markdown), `tool_use`→`role:"tool"` (compact `Name(arg)` chip), user string→
  `role:"user"`; thinking/tool_result/system-scaffolding skipped. Claude-only; other runtimes keep
  the scrape fallback (no regression). `mailink/transcript.rs`, unit-tested + validated on a real
  942-turn transcript.
- **Live per-turn WS streaming — DONE** (`fa3b971`): supersedes the "still a refinement" note above.
  `stream_new_messages` (`mailink/mod.rs`) runs a 400ms mtime-gated ticker that diffs each designated
  tab's transcript and pushes one `{type:"message", role, text, msg_id, ts}` frame per newly-appended
  turn. Streams `agent`/`tool`/`system`; **never** the phone's own `role:"user"` turns. Frame fields are
  byte-identical to `GET`'s `turns_for_session(sid, 40, Marker)`, so the phone dedups the streamed frame
  and any REST re-fetch to one entry. Latency win (≤400ms vs the old 1.5-2s re-pull), turn-granular by design.
- **Context-compaction divider — DONE** (`3d96159`): a `compact_boundary` entry (`type:"system"`,
  `subtype:"compact_boundary"`, fields TOP-LEVEL — no nested `message`) becomes one `role:"system"` turn
  `Context compacted · <pre> → <post>` (prefix `Auto-compacted` when `compactMetadata.trigger=="auto"`;
  bare label if metadata absent). `msg_id = entry.uuid` so stream + GET dedup; the streamer already passes
  non-user roles, so it pushes live with no streamer change. The app renders `role:"system"` as a labeled
  divider. Same commit drops the injected post-compaction summary (a `user` entry with
  `isCompactSummary:true`, ~12k chars) that `is_system_noise` didn't catch and was leaking as a giant fake
  user message. Adds `fmt_tokens_k` (776k / 1.2M rounding).
- **Codex + agent-prompts pass — DONE** (2026-07-02, four commits):
  - **Runtime-aware `/respond` keystrokes.** Codex's approval overlay is a *variable-length*
    list (2–5 options) where digits select by POSITION — Claude's fixed `1/2/3` could land
    "No" on a "Yes, and don't ask again…" row. Codex answers now inject its stable default
    letter shortcuts (`y`=approve, `a`=approve-for-session, `n`=decline, per codex-rs
    `tui/src/keymap.rs`); digits from the phone are translated, never passed through. Claude
    keeps the numeric menu.
  - **Codex per-turn transcripts + meta.** `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*-<sid>.jsonl`
    (append-only across resumes; located newest-first, path-cached) distills
    `response_item`s: assistant `output_text`→`agent`, genuine user `input_text`→`user`
    (`<tagged>` scaffolding dropped), `function_call`/`custom_tool_call`→`tool` chips
    (`msg_id` = `cx<line>[:<block>]`, stable for stream/GET dedup). `meta` reads the last
    `token_count` — `last_token_usage.total_tokens` over the stated `model_context_window`
    (exactly codex-rs's own gauge; the `total_token_usage` running sum exceeds the window on
    long sessions) — and `turn_context.model`. Session resolution is runtime-aware
    (`codexSessionId` covers the resume-before-init window), so WS streaming, detail, gauge,
    and recency all work for Codex like Claude. Gemini still falls back to the scrape.
  - **Permission cards show WHAT is being approved.** Sessions capture a compact
    `tool_detail` from the PreToolUse `tool_input` (refreshed from Codex's
    `PermissionRequest`, which carries `tool_name`/`tool_input` on the event) → synthesized
    text is now e.g. `Bash(rm -rf ./dist) — approve?`.
  - **Attention/doorbell transition semantics.** Both tickers diff `state|prompt-kind` (chats
    gain an additive `prompt: "question"|"permission"|null` field) and fire only when a
    *previously-observed* tab transitions INTO attention — a tab merely appearing in the
    roster already idle (exposure toggled, restore) no longer pushes a phantom "finished",
    and an AskUserQuestion opening without a coincident permission notification now rings.
    Chat detail's `unread` counts an open ask like the inbox does.
  - **Bridge/mesh envelope filtering.** `⟦AGENT-BRIDGE⟧`/`⟦MESH⟧`/`⟦TOPIC COMPLETE⟧`
    injections are delivered as real user prompts and were rendering as giant fake "user"
    messages flooding every mesh participant's thread — now dropped by the transcript noise
    filter (and excluded from last-turn recency).
  - **The 60s ask deadline (field bug, 2026-07-02; expiry contract revised 2026-07-03).**
    Claude Code fires NO notification hook for an AskUserQuestion (anthropics/claude-code#13830)
    — state stays `active`. The prompt-kind transition above closes that signaling gap;
    `pendingPrompt` gains additive **`asked_at`** (unix ms, stamped at PreToolUse),
    `questions[].options[]` pass through Claude's per-option `preview`, and the transcript
    chip reads `AskUserQuestion(<first question>)` so an expired ask still shows what was
    asked. Late answers fall back to a free-text `/message`.
    **Expiry**: the 60s auto-resolve existed ONLY in CC 2.1.198–2.1.199 (hard-coded); 2.1.200
    made it **opt-in** via `askUserQuestionTimeout` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (user scope
    only: `"never"` default | `"60s"` | `"5m"` | `"10m"`; multiple-choice questions only —
    permission prompts never auto-resolve). So `pendingPrompt` carries an additive
    **`expires_at`** (absolute unix ms of the actual auto-resolve moment, un-buffered) and it
    is **authoritative**: the desktop emits it only when the session's CC build + settings
    actually expire the ask (version gate read from the session JSONL's per-entry `version`
    field + the settings key — `ask_deadline_ms` in `mailink/mod.rs`). **Absent ⇒ the app
    shows NO countdown** and the question stays answerable until the prompt clears. The app
    closes its tappable window at `expires_at − 5000` (keystroke-inject headroom) and then
    routes to the composer; `asked_at` is display-only ("asked 2m ago") — the app derives no
    deadline from it. Unknown version ⇒ no `expires_at` (a false countdown expires a live
    question; a missing one degrades safely to stale-guard + composer fallback).
- **Two findings (notes, not blockers):** (1) `/message` bracketed-paste is correct for an
  agent TUI but leaks into a bare shell — fine for the intended use; (2) the *first*
  permission (for `initSession` itself) can't be tab-attributed since the session→tab mapping
  happens behind it (surfaces only in a dev/prod dual-instance setup).
- **Known refinements (not blocking):** WS is a ~1.5s internal poller (push-from-hooks later);
  real prompt text/options + stable `prompt_id` need deeper hook capture (prompt lives in the
  TUI, not `agent_sessions`); real `lastActivityTs`/`unread`; question-attention over WS; live
  `message`-over-WS echoes (transcript turns now distilled — see above).

## 12. v0.3 — Topic threads & the unified ask contract

This section is the **canonical contract** for the topic-threaded surface. It supersedes the
chat-centric shapes of §2.1 (designation), §4 (wire), §5 (respond), and §8 (discovery) where
they conflict; the transport, TLS, pairing, and doorbell mechanics (§3, §6) are unchanged.

**Why.** maiTerm's Mesh Workspace is **topic-native**: agents converse in topic-scoped threads
(`MeshTopic` — owner, participants, turn count, open/complete, normalized-label dedup). Per-tab
`/chats` leaked an implementation detail (one tab = one session) into the UI. A **thread = a
conversation** is the right model for a chat app, so the app unifies on one `thread` concept and
renders it once.

**Single ask channel (no double-messaging).** The only "human needs to answer" signal is the
agent's **native** prompt — Claude `AskUserQuestion` (structured multiple-choice elicitation) or a
permission prompt — which maiTerm already tracks as `isAwaitingHumanInput`. The desktop side has
**removed** the old agent-authored "status note / NEEDS DECISION" channel and instructs agents to
ask via `AskUserQuestion` only (never print the question, never write a note). One ask in → one
`PendingPrompt` → one card → one `/respond` out. On desktop the same signal raises a scoped
toast + deep-link; on the phone it's the WS `attention` + doorbell.

### 12.1 Canonical TS types (adopted from the maiLink app side)

```ts
export type Runtime = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';

/** A participating agent in a thread. id is tabId-derived (stable across resume/fork) but is NOT the thread key. */
export interface Participant { id: string; name: string; runtime: Runtime; meta?: AgentMeta; }

/** Per-agent telemetry strip (thread header). All fields optional; the gauge is driven by contextPct. */
export interface AgentMeta {
  model?: string;         // normalized display name: "Opus 5", "GPT-5-codex", "Gemini 2.5 Pro"
  effort?: string;        // Claude reasoning tier: low | medium | high | xhigh | max. Read from the
                          //   transcript's top-level `effort` field (same assistant line as usage).
                          //   OMITTED for effort-less models, non-Claude runtimes, or before the first turn.
  contextPct?: number;    // 0–100, normalized — the always-present field
  contextUsed?: number;   // token detail for the "142k / 1M" readout
  contextLimit?: number;  // model-dependent (1,000,000 for [1m] variants, else 200,000)
}

export type ThreadKind = 'topic' | 'solo';
export type ThreadState = 'active' | 'idle' | 'permission' | 'dormant';

/** Inbox row. GET /threads -> ThreadSummary[] */
export interface ThreadSummary {
  thread_id: string;            // canonical key everywhere (replaces tabId)
  kind: ThreadKind;             // topic = N participants, solo = lone agent tab
  label: string;                // topic label or solo tab title
  owner: string;                // owner participant id
  participants: Participant[];  // drives attribution chips (runtime glyph)
  workspace: string;            // grouping
  state: ThreadState;
  unread: boolean;
  lastActivityTs: number;
  preview: string;
}

/** GET /threads/{thread_id} -> ThreadDetail */
export interface ThreadDetail extends ThreadSummary {
  transcript: Turn[];           // ONE ts-ordered authored list, all participants interleaved
  goal?: AgentGoal;             // the /goal condition being enforced (§4.3) — Claude, GET only

  goal?: {                      // present iff kind === 'goal_status'
    event: 'set' | 'blocked' | 'met' | 'failed' | 'cleared';
    condition: string;
  };
  peer?: {                      // present iff kind === 'peer_message'
    direction: 'in' | 'out';    // the only required field
    name?: string;              // peer's role name; ABSENT on a 1:1 bridge with nothing to name —

  ts: number;
  queuedAt?: number;            // role:'user' only. Present when the message was typed while the
                                //   agent was MID-TURN: Claude Code queues those and writes no
                                //   `user` turn for them at all — only a `queued_command`
                                //   attachment, at DRAIN time, stamped with the ENQUEUE time.
                                //   `ts` is therefore the drain position (so the message sorts
                                //   after the work it waited on, not above it — otherwise it
                                //   reads as answered before it was sent) and `queuedAt` carries
                                //   the true send time. A client can show "sent 15:25, answered
                                //   15:26"; ignoring it is fine.
}

// kind:"terminal_snapshot" — emitted for tabs with no locatable JSONL (a pruned local session,
// Gemini, a plain shell, or an SSH tab whose transcript mirror is unavailable — see below). It is a
// single system turn holding a raw scrape of the tab's live terminal grid (last ~40 rows,
// newline-delimited, may contain TUI chrome), with a STABLE msg_id (`ctx_<tabId>`) that is
// re-scraped on every GET. Render it preformatted (white-space: pre-wrap; overflow-wrap:
// break-word), badged as a live terminal snapshot, and treat it as ONE replaceable block — not
// appended history. Older clients can sniff the `ctx_` msg_id prefix for the same signal. Dormant
// tabs (no live PTY) omit it entirely → empty transcript → "no messages captured yet".
//
// SSH Claude tabs (v2 transcript mirror): the desktop mirrors the session's REMOTE JSONL into a
// local shadow file (offset-tracked `tail` fetches mux'd over the SSH bridge tunnel's maiTerm-owned
// ControlMaster socket; hook events are the fetch trigger, plus a slow keep-fresh tick while a WS
// client is connected). With a healthy mirror an SSH Claude tab serves REAL distilled turns —
// indistinguishable on the wire from a local tab (same GET shape, same `message` WS streaming, same
// per-agent meta) — and the snapshot turn does not appear. If the mirror can't fetch (tunnel down,
// bridge disabled), the tab degrades to exactly the snapshot fallback above. No client-side changes
// are required either way. Codex/Gemini SSH tabs always use the snapshot path.

// kind:"peer_message" — an agent-to-agent exchange (maiTerm Agent Bridge / Mesh Workspace),
// surfaced so a peer conversation is visible in the thread instead of silently absent. Render as a
// THIN notification-style row ("peer message received from X" / "sent to X"), not a message bubble:
// it is neither party of this thread's conversation. `role` is always "system" for this reason —
// and because the WS streamer never sends `role:"user"` frames, so a user-roled peer turn would be
// missing on the live path and appear only on the next GET.
//
//   * direction:"in"  — a message this agent RECEIVED. maiTerm delivers these as real user prompts
//     wrapped in a ⟦AGENT-BRIDGE⟧ / ⟦MESH⟧ envelope; the desktop strips the routing header so `text`
//     is the peer's actual message body. (Un-stripped, they used to render as giant fake "user"
//     messages, so they were dropped entirely — hence previously invisible.)
//   * direction:"out" — a message this agent SENT, from its `sendToBridgedAgent` call. This turn
//     REPLACES that call's tool chip; the same send never appears twice. `text` is the message sent.
//
// Only genuine peer traffic is tagged: bridge openers, ⟦TOPIC COMPLETE⟧ notices and disconnect
// notices remain filtered as scaffolding, and human/subagent messaging tools (postCommsReply,
// startCommsThread, SendMessage) keep their ordinary tool chips. Emitted identically on GET and on
// the WS `message` event, which carries `kind` and `peer` alongside the usual fields.

// kind:"goal_status" — one /goal state change, in the place in the conversation where it happened.
// The thread-level `goal` field (§4.3) says where things STAND; these rows are the history of how
// it got there, and on a goal that has been turned around a few times they read as a genuine
// progress log. Render as a thin marker row like peer_message, not a message bubble; `role` is
// always "system" for the same two reasons (neither party of the conversation, and the WS streamer
// drops role:"user" frames).
//
//   * event:"set" / "cleared" — the operator installing or removing the goal. No verdict prose
//     exists for these, so `text` is the condition itself.
//   * event:"blocked" — the judge refused to let the turn end. `text` is its explanation of what is
//     still outstanding, which is the single most useful thing in the transcript when you are away
//     from the desk. NOT an ending: the agent was sent straight back to work.
//   * event:"met" / "failed" — the goal was satisfied, or ruled impossible. Terminal either way.
//
// `event` is deliberately finer-grained than the thread field's `state`: a row is a moment
// ("blocked"), the field is a condition ("active").

### 12.2 REST/WS deltas

- `GET /threads` → `ThreadSummary[]` (supersedes `/chats`). `GET /threads/{thread_id}` →
  `ThreadDetail`. `/chats*` may remain a thin alias during migration; `thread_id` is canonical.
- WS event `threads_changed` replaces `chats_changed`. `attention` and `message`/`chat_state`
  events carry `thread_id` (+ `author` on message turns).
- `POST /respond` takes `RespondRequest`; returns `RespondResponse` with `reason:"stale"`
  (prompt_id no longer current) or `reason:"not_respondable"` (a race against a `respondable:false`
  prompt — fails cleanly, no dead button).
- **Doorbell** context (§6) gains `thread_id` + `asked_by` so the notification tap deep-links to the
  thread (not a tabId).

### 12.3 Desktop-side mapping & staging (maiTerm)

- **threads** ← a `kind:"topic"` thread is one `MeshTopic` (id→`thread_id`, label, owner/participants
  by tabId-derived `Participant`); a lone agent tab wraps as `kind:"solo"`. `tabId` is the
  participant `id`, never the thread key.
- **transcript** ← per-turn distillation already exists (`mailink/transcript.rs`, §11); add
  `author` (the participant) + `thread_id` per turn and interleave participants by `ts` for a
  topic thread. The app synthesizes the visual grouping; no server-side thread view.
- **PendingPrompt** ← captured from the **PreToolUse hook**, which carries the full `tool_input`.
  **IMPLEMENTED (desktop):** `AskUserQuestion`'s `tool_input` is stored on the session
  (`AgentSessionInfo.pending_question`, set on PreToolUse / cleared on PostToolUse+Stop) and
  served by maiLink as a structured `pendingPrompt.questions[]` = `{header, question, multiSelect,
  options:[{label, description}], allowOther:true}` with `kind:"question"`, `thread_id`,
  `respondable:false`. Permission stays synthesized (`kind:"permission"`, `respondable:true`,
  `options:["Yes","Yes, don't ask again","No"]`). `asked_by` for solo threads = the tab's agent
  (the app's adapter fills it today; native field follows with `/threads`).
- **respondable staging:**
  - `permission` → `respondable:true` **now**. The permission `/respond`→TUI-inject path is already
    proven end-to-end on hardware (§11 doorbell finale) — converging to threads must NOT regress it.
  - `AskUserQuestion` → `respondable:true` **now** (was staged false). `drive_question_answers`
    (`mailink/mod.rs`) drives the TUI selector by keystroke; mechanics pinned live against Claude
    Code 2.1.x. The selector is a tab row `[Q1..Qn][Submit]`, arrow-navigable only (the shown 1..n
    are labels, not digit keys), highlight starts at row 0:
    - **single-select:** ↑/↓ to the row, Enter selects AND advances to the next tab.
    - **multiSelect:** Space toggles each row (live), then → advances the tab.
    - **Other free-text:** the "Type something" row (index = option_count) is a live inline input —
      navigate to it and TYPE directly (no Enter-to-open); single-select then Enter-advances.
    - **submit:** a lone single-select question submits on its own Enter; every other form lands on
      the Submit tab and takes one final Enter.
    Verified e2e (agent echoed exact answers): single-select, single-select+Other, multiSelect,
    mixed multi-question. **Best-guess pending device validation:** multiSelect + Other in the same
    question (type → Enter-commit → →), because the active input swallowed the raw → in probes.
    No "answer on desktop" fallback — every phone-reachable shape must work in-app.
- **answer field names — PINNED:** the emitted question fields are exactly
  `{header, question, multiSelect, options:[{label, description}], allowOther}` (§12.1, verbatim
  from Claude's `tool_input` + synthesized `allowOther:true`); the answer is
  `RespondRequest.answers[]` aligned to `questions[]`, each `{selected: string[], other?: string}`.
  No rename needed app-side — §12.1 is canonical. (`/respond` write path for questions is the
  remaining desktop item: translate `answers[]` → the TUI selection, then flip `respondable:true`.)
- **meta (per-agent telemetry) — IMPLEMENTED (Claude + Codex):** `model` + `contextPct`/
  `contextUsed`/`contextLimit`, read from the session's transcript file
  (`mailink/transcript.rs`, dispatched by runtime):
  - *Claude*: the last JSONL line carrying `message.usage`, summed
    `input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens`, over a
    model-dependent limit, and `model` normalized from `message.model`
    ("claude-opus-5" → "Opus 5"). The limit is 1,000,000 for `[1m]`/`-1m` ids — but note the
    transcript's `message.model` NEVER carries that marker (Claude Code exposes it only on the
    statusLine input, which maiTerm doesn't receive), so a 1M session and a 200k one report the
    same bare id. The desktop therefore infers it: an allowlist of ids whose 1M variant is the
    one in use (`ASSUMED_1M_MODELS` in `mailink/mod.rs`), plus a backstop that treats any
    session already past 200,000 tokens as 1M. Clients should treat `contextLimit` as
    authoritative and not re-derive it from the model name.
  - *Codex*: the rollout's last `token_count` — `last_token_usage.total_tokens` over the
    stated `model_context_window` — and `turn_context.model` ("gpt-5.5" → "GPT-5.5").
  Emitted on the `/chats` object, in `chat_detail`, and on the WS `chat_state` event (so the
  gauge steps live per turn). `effort` is omitted (only in Claude Code's statusLine payload,
  not received). Gemini tabs get no `meta` (no transcript source yet).
