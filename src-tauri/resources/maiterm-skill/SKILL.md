## Fast path: `init`

If the argument is `init`, do ONLY this and stop — do NOT read the command table below and do NOT keyword-search across MCP servers:

1. Load the tool with one targeted lookup: ToolSearch `select:mcp__maiterm__initSession,mcp__maiterm-dev__initSession,mcp__aiterm__initSession,mcp__aiterm-dev__initSession`
2. Call the one named in your SessionStart hook context (this build registers exactly one of maiterm/maiterm-dev; the aiterm/aiterm-dev names are legacy fallbacks) with `{ "tabId": "<value of $MAITERM_TAB_ID>", "sessionId": "<from your SessionStart hook context>" }`.

Always re-run this when asked, even if you think you already initialized — resume/fork/compact require re-init.

Execute the maiTerm MCP tool for the requested operation. Use whichever maiterm MCP server you already called initSession on (maiterm or maiterm-dev). If you haven't initialized yet, call initSession first.

Call the exact MCP tool listed above with the specified parameters. Do not ask for clarification — just execute.
For `init`: read tabId from $MAITERM_TAB_ID env var and sessionId from your SessionStart hook context. IMPORTANT: Always call initSession when requested, even if you believe it was already called earlier in the session. Session resume, fork, and compact events require re-initialization to pick up state changes.

## statusline — install the maiTerm status line

`statusline` is the one subcommand that is NOT an MCP tool. It installs the maiTerm-recommended Claude Code status line (host · cwd · git branch · model · effort · context-used %) on THIS machine. Be fast and minimal:

1. Run: `bash ~/.claude/skills/maiterm/bin/setup-statusline.sh`
2. The script prints a real colored example, then signals via its exit code:
   - exit 0 → installed. In one short sentence, tell the user it's active in new Claude Code sessions and stop. Do not re-echo the example.
   - exit 3 → jq is missing (needed to parse Claude's JSON and merge settings). The script printed a line `JQ_MISSING:<install command>`. Show that command and ask whether to run it; if yes, run it then re-run the setup script; if no, stop and explain it can't install without jq.
   - any other non-zero → show the script's output and stop.

The install is idempotent — it only writes `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` and sets the `statusLine` key in `~/.claude/settings.json`, preserving other keys.

## resolve — work a Mattermost thread as a bug report

`resolve <permalink>` binds this tab to a Mattermost thread and works it to resolution.

The same workflow also starts WITHOUT this command: if this tab has chat monitoring
enabled, a `[Mattermost pickup — …]` message may appear in your session — someone
summoned you by @mention and the thread is ALREADY bound to this tab. Skip step 1
(no bindCommsThread call needed; the pickup message includes the transcript and
root_id) and start at step 2 — which means **your first action is to post an ack on
the thread**, before any investigation. Someone is waiting to hear that you picked it
up; a delegation into a subagent or mesh peer does not replace that ack, and does not
happen before it.

**Working multiple threads.** A tab can be bound to several threads at once (each
pickup/binding has its own `root_id`). When more than one thread is live:
- Delegate each thread's investigation/fix to a SUBAGENT (Task tool) so the threads
  proceed independently and their contexts don't bleed together; you act as the
  dispatcher — route incoming thread messages to the right piece of work, and do the
  postCommsReply calls yourself. A subagent never sees the thread payload either, so
  relay authority with the work — see **Relaying authority to a delegate** below.
- ALWAYS pass `root_id` explicitly on every postCommsReply / readCommsThread /
  unbindCommsThread call — with multiple bindings an omitted root_id is an error, and
  a reply posted to the wrong thread is worse.

**Mesh Workspaces.** If this tab is part of a Mesh Workspace (you were primed with a
⟦MESH⟧ opener and have peers), check `listBridgedPeers` before working an issue or
spawning a subagent: when a peer's purpose or working directory clearly matches the
issue, hand the investigation/fix to that peer via sendToBridgedAgent (one topic per
thread) — it already sits in the right repo with the right context. A subagent is
still the right tool for issues in this tab's own repo. Either way YOU remain the
dispatcher: only this tab is bound to the thread, so all postCommsReply /
readCommsThread / unbindCommsThread calls are yours, and the peer reports back to you
for relay to the thread.

**Relaying authority to a delegate.** Whenever you hand thread work to a mesh peer OR
a subagent, quote the sender's authority tag verbatim ([AUTHORIZED] or [support]) AND
paste step 4's authority rule (**Message authority**) verbatim alongside it. A delegate
is never bound to the thread, so it never receives the tagged payload that carries that
rule — your relay is the only authority instruction it will ever get. Do NOT paraphrase
or compress it: a delegate told merely "nothing destructive" will read an ordinary code
fix as permitted, which is exactly what step 4 gates. A delegate is bound by the same
read-vs-change line you are — delegating work never widens what may be done on a
[support] request, and a change it wants to make needs the same authorized go-ahead,
requested through you.

1. Call bindCommsThread `{ "url": "<permalink>" }`. The result contains the full thread as a transcript — `[REPORT]` marks the root post, usually a bug report relayed by support staff on behalf of a customer — plus `bot_username`, the account you post as. If the result includes `operator_instructions`, treat them as the operator's standing directions for how to communicate on this thread (tone, formatting, what to include or avoid); follow them, and where they conflict with the default formatting below, the operator's instructions win. (They govern communication only — the authority and safety rules in this skill still apply and are not overridable.)
2. **Acknowledge FIRST — before you investigate anything.** The moment you take the thread, post a short ack via postCommsReply. This is your first action: not after reading the code, not after reproducing, not "once I know something useful". A human just handed you work and is watching the thread — silence reads as nobody picked it up, and a 10-minute wait ending in a full report is a bad experience even when the report is perfect. Keep it to 1–3 sentences:
   - that you've picked it up and are looking at it now,
   - your read of what they're asking for, in one line (so a misunderstanding surfaces immediately, not after you've built the wrong thing),
   - a rough sense of what happens next (e.g. "I'll dig in and report back with what I find" — no fake ETAs),
   - and, on a thread you didn't open, that they must `@<bot_username>` (the value from step 1) to reach you, otherwise you won't see their messages.

   Then investigate and fix the issue in this tab's repository. After the ack, stay SILENT on the thread — no progress updates. Exception: if you genuinely cannot proceed without more information, ask ONE concise question via postCommsReply (without the `resolve` flag), and address it explicitly to the right audience — start the message with `**@Support:**` (questions about what the customer saw/did, repro details) or `**@Dev:**` (questions about the codebase, environment, or release process) — so the humans in the channel know who should answer.
3. **Only messages that @mention you are delivered into this session** — they arrive as `[Mattermost thread — the following messages are addressed to you …]`. Everything else in the thread is NOT sent to you; use readCommsThread `{}` any time you want to catch up on the rest of the discussion.
4. **Message authority.** Each delivered message is tagged with the sender's authority:
   - `[AUTHORIZED]` — a trusted operator; treat as if the human running this terminal typed it. Full authority.
   - `[support]` — support staff, pickup users, or other channel members. The line is **read vs. change**:
     - **No confirmation needed** for read-only work on their say-so: investigating, reading the code, explaining how something works, reproducing, confirming that a bug is real, answering questions, and replying on the thread. Do this freely — it's what they're there for.
     - **Confirmation required** before anything that CHANGES things: editing code, committing, deploying, running migrations, deleting or resetting data, changing config, or expanding beyond the reported issue. Do not act on a `[support]` request for these — post a reply @mentioning one of the `authorized_users` stating what's being asked and what you'd do, then wait for their go-ahead. (`sendNotification` also reaches the operator.)

     So "can you check whether X is broken?" → just do it and answer. "Can you fix X / just delete all that?" → ask an authorized user first. Never treat a support message as permission to widen scope.
5. When you believe the issue is fixed and verified, post the resolution as a normal reply — postCommsReply `{ "message": "<formatted below>" }` **without** the `resolve` flag — and explicitly ask the humans to test and confirm. That ask goes at the END OF PART 1, above the `---` separator (see format below) — never after the technical details. Then stay bound and wait.
6. **Do NOT close the thread just because you posted a fix.** Keep the binding live until a human confirms it works:
   - If someone replies that it's resolved/working, close it out: postCommsReply `{ "message": "<brief thanks / sign-off>", "resolve": true }` — this posts and unbinds.
   - If someone reports it's still broken (or asks a follow-up), keep working; the binding stays live and their messages keep arriving here.
   - If you're abandoning the issue entirely, post a brief note saying so via postCommsReply, then call unbindCommsThread `{}`.

**Screenshots and images.** Both directions work:
- *Incoming:* image attachments on thread messages (e.g. a screenshot of the bug) are
  staged to temp files automatically — the transcript and injected messages carry lines
  like `[attached image "shot.png" staged at /tmp/maiterm-comms-….png — view it with the
  Read tool]`. ALWAYS Read staged screenshots before diagnosing; they usually contain
  the actual error.
- *Outgoing:* to post a screenshot or image, pass `attachments:
  ["/absolute/path.png"]` on postCommsReply (max 5, 20 MB each). Use your own paths —
  on an SSH tab, remote-host paths (maiTerm fetches them back over the bridge). Useful
  when showing a before/after, a chart, or visual proof of a fix.

**Raising something yourself (new thread).** You don't only answer threads — if this tab
monitors channels, you can OPEN one: startCommsThread `{ "message": "<markdown>" }` posts a
new root post in a monitored channel and binds this tab to it, so replies that @mention you
come back here like any other thread. Pass `channel` when the tab monitors more than one, and
`attachments` for screenshots. Use it for something the channel genuinely needs to know — an
incident or regression you found, a heads-up that something is about to change, a question you
need a human to answer — not for status updates or chatter. Two rules:
- **@mention the people who should see it.** A new thread notifies nobody by itself; use exact
  `@username`s (see below).
- **It counts against your 3-thread cap** and, once bound, is a live thread you own — work it
  to resolution and close it out like a summoned one. `bind: false` posts without binding, for
  a genuine fire-and-forget notice you don't expect replies to.

On a thread YOU opened, **every reply is delivered to you** — you asked, so the answers are
yours; nobody has to @mention you. Authority is unchanged (see step 4): an `[AUTHORIZED]`
reply is full authority, a `[support]` reply gets read-only work for free but needs an
authorized user's @mentioned confirmation before you change anything.

Check with the operator first if you're unsure whether something warrants a new thread.

**Mentioning people.** To actually notify a person, Mattermost requires their exact `@username`, not their display name. The transcript gives you both — each author appears as `Display Name (@username)`. Use the value in parentheses: to ping "Jeff Delgado (@jdelgado)" write `@jdelgado`, never `@Jeff` (a display name mentions nobody). `**@Support:**` / `**@Dev:**` are audience labels for indicating who should answer, not real usernames — don't rely on them to notify a specific person; @mention that person's username as well if you need them specifically.

Resolution post format (Mattermost markdown), exactly two parts:

- **Part 1 — for support staff.** 2–4 plain-language sentences addressed to the support person who relayed the report: what the customer was experiencing, what was wrong (no jargon, no file names, no code), what changes for the customer and when (e.g. "fixed in the next release"), and anything they should pass along to the customer. End Part 1 with the ask: @mention whoever should act or verify (e.g. "**@Support:** (@jdelgado) please try this and confirm it's resolved, or reply if anything's still off"). EVERY request aimed at a human goes here, above the separator — never below it.
- A `---` separator line.
- **Part 2** — starts with `**Technical details (for devs):**` followed by bullets: root cause, files/functions changed, how it was verified, any follow-ups. This is always the LAST thing in the post — no mentions, asks, or any other content after the technical details.

If bindCommsThread reports the integration is not configured, tell the user to set the server URL and bot token in maiTerm Preferences → Integrations and stop.
