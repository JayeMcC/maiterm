#!/usr/bin/env bash
# maiTerm agent hook shim (Codex + Cursor).
#
# Codex and Cursor hooks are COMMAND hooks (no native HTTP hook type), so each
# lifecycle event runs this script, which forwards the event to the local maiTerm
# MCP server's /hooks endpoint — the same endpoint Claude Code posts to over HTTP.
# Both pass the hook event as JSON on stdin.
#
# Args / env (set by maiTerm at install + PTY spawn):
#   $1            the MCP auth token (embedded in the runtime's hooks.json by its Registrar)
#   $2            (optional) the MCP server port baked at install time. Used for the
#                 SSH-remote install, where the reverse-tunnel port is fixed for the
#                 bridge and the live shell may lack $MAITERM_PORT (tmux/sudo/su). Local
#                 installs omit it and rely on the per-process $MAITERM_PORT env var.
#   $3            (optional) the runtime tag for ?runtime= (default "codex"; "cursor" for
#                 the Cursor CLI). Tells maiTerm's /hooks handler which event-name schema
#                 to normalize.
#   $MAITERM_PORT  the maiTerm MCP server port (live, per-process)
#   $MAITERM_TAB_ID  the maiTerm tab this Codex session runs in
#
# ?tab_id routes the event to the right frontend tab. Output is a bare `{}` (a valid
# no-op decision) so hooks that expect JSON on stdout (Codex Stop/PreToolUse/
# PermissionRequest; Cursor beforeShellExecution/stop) get a well-formed "no decision"
# and never block the turn.
