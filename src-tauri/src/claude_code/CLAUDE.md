# Claude Code IDE Integration

aiTerm exposes an MCP server that Claude Code CLI discovers and connects to, providing IDE-like capabilities.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code CLI ←→ WebSocket/SSE ←→ axum server (Rust) ←→ Tauri events ←→ Frontend (Svelte)
```

**Backend** (`src-tauri/src/claude_code/`):
- `server.rs` — axum router with WebSocket (`/`) and SSE (`/sse` + `/message`) endpoints. Random port (10000–65535), 32-char auth token.
- `protocol.rs` — JSON-RPC request/response types, `tool_list_response()` (42 tools), `initialize_response()`
- `lockfile.rs` — writes `~/.claude/ide/{port}.lock` for discovery, registers `mcpServers.aiterm` (or `aiterm-dev`) in `~/.claude.json`, registers hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`

**Frontend** (`src/lib/stores/claudeCode.svelte.ts`):
- Listens for `claude-code-tool` Tauri events
- Dispatches to tool handlers (getOpenEditors, openFile, openDiff, etc.)
- Responds via `claude_code_respond` Tauri command

**Enabled by**: `preferences.claude_code_ide` (default true). Server startup is two-phase: `prepare_server()` runs synchronously inside Tauri's `setup()` (binds the TCP port, writes `~/.claude.json`, hooks, skill), then `serve_server()` runs as a background tokio task that adopts the pre-bound listener and runs `axum::serve`. The sync prep is load-bearing — frontend doesn't load (and no PTY can auto-resume `claude --resume …`) until `~/.claude.json` has the current port.

## Agent Link (agent-to-agent bridge)

Lets two running Claude agents in different panes talk to each other. The human links
the active tab to another running Claude session via the **Agent Link picker**
(`Cmd+Shift+L`, or terminal context menu → "Link to Agent…"). The agents then converse
asynchronously via the `sendToLinkedAgent` tool; each message is injected as a real
terminal turn in the recipient's pane, so the human watches the whole exchange and can
interrupt with Esc.

**Two link modes (picker toggle):**
- **Fork into new pane** (default) — `establishLink()` forks the target session
  (`claude --resume <id> --fork-session`) into a split pane beside the caller: an
  isolated peer with the target's full context that doesn't disturb the original.
- **Link existing tab** — `linkExistingTab()` links two already-running Claude tabs
  directly, no fork/new pane (for when the split already exists, e.g. a failed
  auto-relink). Idempotent: re-selecting the caller's own partner *repairs* a broken
  link in place; it refuses to hijack a tab linked to a third agent.

**Human-guided opener:** the picker has an optional textarea where the human describes
the peer (what it's expert on / how to use it). The opener fed to the calling agent does
NOT fire questions immediately — it tells the agent to check in with the human first
(summarize what the peer offers, propose a few things it could ask) and wait for
direction before using `sendToLinkedAgent`. The description is in-memory (one-time, not
persisted).

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/stores/agentLink.svelte.ts` — link registry (keyed by tab_id, symmetric),
  `establishLink()` (fork + handshake), `linkExistingTab()` (no-fork link/repair),
  `primeFork()` (auto-init directive), `rehydrate()` (rebuild from persisted state),
  delivery gating, identity envelopes
- `src/lib/stores/workspaces.svelte.ts` → `forkSessionIntoSplit()` — splits the caller's
  pane and boots the forked partner (reuses the clone/auto-resume spawn path with
  `setSplitContext({ fireAutoResume: true })`)
- `src/lib/components/AgentLinkPicker.svelte` — session picker modal (mode toggle + purpose textarea)
- `claudeCode.svelte.ts` → `handleSendToLinkedAgent` / `handleGetLinkedAgent` dispatch
- Persistence: `Tab.agent_link` (Rust `AgentLink` struct) via the `set_tab_agent_link`
  command — durable pairing written both sides

**Design decisions (v1):** async-only (no blocking RPC); fork-only (the fork *is* the
target, isolated); loop control = framing + human Esc (no circuit breaker); identity is
stamped by aiTerm from the registry (tamper-proof — recipient can't mistake a peer for
the human); link keyed by tab_id (survives the fork's new session id).

**Handshake (tight, routing-proof):** a forked session resumes the target's transcript,
so it inherits the target's `initSession` and won't re-bind its new MCP connection. After
the fork's Claude boots, `primeFork()` injects a directive forcing it to re-`initSession`
as its OWN tab; that tab's real `claude-init-session` event is the handshake trigger
(proves it's up, on this instance, tool-capable) — not a flaky `SessionStart` hook.

**Delivery readiness model:** per-tab `ready` (caller immediate; fork once its
`initSession` lands), `busy` (set on inject, cleared on that tab's `Stop`),
`hasCompletedTurn` (once true, `claudeState` active/idle is trusted — and a live session
is required, so a dormant/resuming partner queues instead of injecting into a shell).
Messages to a busy/dormant tab queue and flush on its next `Stop`/re-init.

**Persistence & resume (hardening):** the pairing is persisted on both tabs (`Tab.agent_link`),
so a link survives an app restart. On load, `rehydrate()` rebuilds the in-memory registry
for any pair where both tabs still exist and reciprocally reference each other (orphans
cleared). `session-end` only **suspends** the in-memory link (keeps the durable pairing) —
the agent may auto-resume and re-bind; only an explicit unlink or a closed tab tears it
down. Because `claude --resume` can mint a new session id, the recorded `partner_session_id`
is refreshed when a partner re-inits (`claude-init-session`), and a send-time id mismatch
**re-binds** rather than breaking. The fork's auto-resume command is *not* `--fork-session`
(that would re-fork on every resume) — once the fork has its own id, `handleEnableAutoResume`
drops the fork flag so it resumes its own conversation like any Claude tab.

**Injection:** bracketed paste (`ESC[200~ … ESC[201~`) + a deferred `\r` so multi-line
messages stay one prompt and submit cleanly into Claude's TUI.

## Claude Code Hooks Integration

Hooks registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` on MCP server startup, cleaned up on app exit and stale lockfile sweep.

**Hooks registered:**
- `SessionStart` (command): Echoes tab ID into Claude's context. Gated on `$AITERM_PORT` matching server port (prevents dev/prod cross-talk). Output appears collapsed in TUI ("Ran 1 start hook") but injected into model context as system-reminder.
- `SessionStart` (HTTP): POST to `/hooks` with `{session_id, cwd, source, model}`. Registers session→tab mapping in `AppState.claude_sessions`.
- `SessionEnd` (HTTP): Removes session from mapping.
- `Notification` (HTTP): Receives Claude Code notification events.
- `Stop` (HTTP): Receives stop events.

**Connection tab affinity (`initSession`):**
- Claude calls `initSession({ tabId, sessionId })` as its first MCP tool call
- Server stores connection_id → tab_id mapping in `ServerState.connection_tabs`
- All subsequent tool calls on that connection auto-inject `tabId` if missing
- Prevents wrong-tab targeting when user switches tabs while Claude is working
- Connection affinity cleaned up on disconnect (WS close, SSE drop)

**SSE reconnect recovery:** SSE connections over SSH tunnels flap frequently (disconnect/reconnect every few seconds). Each reconnect creates a new SSE session ID, clearing the old `connection_tabs` entry. Without recovery, every tool call after a reconnect fails with "Session not initialized." Fix: when a tool call arrives with no connection affinity, `claude_sessions` is checked for active sessions. If exactly one active session exists, its tab_id is used to auto-restore affinity for the new connection. This avoids requiring Claude to re-call `initSession` after every SSE reconnect.

**Dev/prod isolation:**
- PTY env vars: `AITERM_TAB_ID` (tab ID), `AITERM_PORT` (server port) — set at spawn in `pty/manager.rs`
- Command hook gates on `$AITERM_PORT` match
- MCP tool guard in `server.rs` rejects `tabId` that doesn't exist in this instance
- MCP instructions specify server name (`aiterm` vs `aiterm-dev`)

**`/aiterm` skill (auto-installed):**
- Written to `~/.claude/skills/aiterm/SKILL.md` on startup, removed on exit
- Provides fast slash-command access: `/aiterm notes`, `/aiterm diag`, `/aiterm tabs`, etc.
- Reduces LLM inference by giving explicit tool→parameter mappings
- Uses `mcp_server_key()` to reference correct MCP server (aiterm vs aiterm-dev)

**Stale hook cleanup:** On startup, `write_hook_settings()` sweeps hooks whose port has no live lockfile. `cleanup_stale_lockfiles()` also removes hooks for dead servers by auth token. Port extraction handles both URL format (`127.0.0.1:NNNNN`) and legacy env var format (`AITERM_PORT = "NNNNN"`).

**Auto-open notes panel:** `claudeCode.svelte.ts` auto-opens notes panel when MCP tools write tab notes or workspace notes, switching scope as appropriate.

## SSH MCP Bridge (Remote IDE Tools)

Exposes local MCP tools to Claude Code running on remote servers via SSH reverse tunnels.

**Architecture:**
```
Local aiTerm → SSH reverse tunnel (-R 0:127.0.0.1:{mcp_port}) → Remote :allocated_port
               Background SSH → writes lockfile + ~/.claude.json on remote
Remote Claude Code → discovers ~/.claude/ide/{port}.lock → connects through tunnel → local MCP server
```

**Key files:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/ssh_tunnel.rs` — tunnel lifecycle (start, detach, kill), port parsing, `ssh_run_setup` for background lockfile writing
- `src/lib/stores/sshMcpBridge.svelte.ts` — bridge orchestration, reactive status tracking, ref counting

**Preference:** `claude_code_ide_ssh` (default true, requires `claude_code_ide`). Controls auto-enable on SSH detection.

**Tunnel sharing:** One tunnel per `host_key` (user@host), ref-counted by tab IDs. Last tab detaches → tunnel killed.

**Auto-enable:** SSH sessions detected reactively via terminal title changes — when a title change fires, `getPtyInfo()` checks for a foreground SSH command and enables/disables the bridge accordingly. For restore/clone SSH: polls `getPtyInfo()` every 500ms until SSH is detected (max 15s). `enableBridge` sets a `'pending'` state immediately to prevent race conditions from concurrent title-change calls.

**Remote setup:** Lockfile, `~/.claude.json`, hooks (`~/.claude/settings.json`), skill (`~/.claude/skills/aiterm/SKILL.md`), and `~/.aiterm` env file are written via a separate background SSH connection (`ssh_run_setup`), **not** through the user's interactive PTY. This prevents command injection into running programs (e.g. Claude Code). The setup script uses shell variables for JSON data to avoid nested quoting issues, and pipes JSON to python3/jq via stdin. After setup, `AITERM_TAB_ID` and `AITERM_PORT` env vars are injected into the remote shell via PTY write (leading space suppresses shell history).

**`~/.aiterm` env file:** Written during bridge setup with `export AITERM_TAB_ID=... AITERM_PORT=...`. Sourced as a fallback by the SessionStart hook when `$AITERM_TAB_ID` is empty (e.g. inside tmux where env vars weren't inherited). Users can manually `source ~/.aiterm` in any shell. Overwritten on each bridge connect — self-correcting for stale values.

**Context menu items (SSH tabs with active bridge):**
- "Inject aiTerm Env Vars" — re-writes `export AITERM_TAB_ID=... AITERM_PORT=...` to the PTY for the current shell (useful after tmux attach, sudo, su)
- "Install MCP for Current User" — writes the full setup script (lockfile, MCP, hooks, skill) to the PTY, executing as the current user. Needed after `sudo -i` or `su -l otheruser` where `~/` changed but the tunnel is still accessible on localhost.

**Remote hooks:** All hook events (SessionStart, SessionEnd, Notification, Stop, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PreCompact) are registered on the remote with HTTP hooks pointing to `127.0.0.1:{remotePort}/hooks`. These tunnel back through the SSH reverse tunnel to the local MCP server's hooks handler. A command hook on SessionStart reads `$AITERM_TAB_ID` (from env var injection) and echoes the tab ID into Claude's context. Hooks require python3 on the remote for the settings.json merge.

**Remote cleanup:** Stale lockfile detection on reconnect tests dead ports via `/dev/tcp/localhost/{port}`. No EXIT trap (background SSH has no persistent shell on remote). Stale hooks with dead port URLs are harmless (fail silently) and cleaned up on next bridge setup.

**Port allocation:** `ssh -v -R 0:...` lets SSH pick a free remote port. The `-v` flag is required because ControlMaster mux clients print nothing without it. Port parsed from both stdout and stderr (direct connections use stderr, mux clients use stderr with `-v`). Uses `tokio::select!` to read both streams concurrently.

**ControlMaster mux:** Tunnel and setup SSH commands do **not** use `-o ControlMaster=no` — this lets them multiplex over the user's existing authenticated socket (free auth for password/passphrase users). Mux clients exit immediately after setup (the master holds the forwarding), so the background process monitor only removes tunnel state on error exits, not clean exits.

**Bridge status UI:** Reactive `$state` Map in `sshMcpBridge.svelte.ts` drives a bolt icon in TerminalTabs (green=connected, dim/fg-dim=pending, dim=failed). Failure dispatches an in-app notification via `notificationDispatch`.

## SSH-Specific Pitfalls

- **SSH ControlMaster mux silent output**: When SSH multiplexes through an existing master socket, `ssh -R 0:...` prints nothing to stdout or stderr without `-v`. The "Allocated port" message only appears with verbose mode. Additionally, the mux client exits immediately with code 0 after setting up the forwarding — the master process holds the tunnel. Background tunnel monitors must not clean up state on clean exit.
- **SSH background command quoting**: Shell commands sent via `ssh user@host 'script'` must use newlines (not `;`) as separators — `do;`, `then;`, `else;` are syntax errors. JSON data should be stored in shell variables and passed to python3/jq via stdin to avoid nested quote hell.
