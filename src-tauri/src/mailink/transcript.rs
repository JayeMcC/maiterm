//! Per-turn source-markdown distillation for the maiLink chat surface (docs/mailink-protocol.md).
//!
//! The old transcript was `recent_text()` — a flattened scrape of the TUI frame (box-drawing,
//! the `❯` prompt, footer; the agent's markdown already rendered-then-ANSI-stripped). That reads
//! as terminal chrome in the phone's GFM renderer. Instead we read each turn's **source markdown**
//! straight from the agent's session transcript (the actual output, pre-TUI-render).
//!
//! Two sources, dispatched by runtime (`turns_for` / `meta_for` / `mtime_for` /
//! `last_turn_ts_for`):
//!   * **Claude** — `~/.claude/projects/*/<session_id>.jsonl`, located by the unique session id.
//!   * **Codex** — `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<session_id>.jsonl` (codex-rs
//!     appends to the same rollout on resume, so the path is stable per session id).
//!
//! Each maiLink message is `{msg_id, role, text, ts}` where role is the frozen contract set
//! `agent | user | system | tool`:
//!   - assistant text            → role "agent" (the markdown that lights up code fences/lists)
//!   - tool calls                → role "tool", a slim one-line marker (e.g. `Bash(rm …)`)
//!   - genuine human messages    → role "user"
//! Thinking/reasoning blocks and tool outputs are skipped (private / noisy). Gemini and Cursor
//! have no transcript source yet; callers fall back to `recent_text()` when nothing resolves.
