/**
 * Agent Bridge — a bridge between two running Claude agents in different maiTerm panes.
 *
 * The human bridges the current tab to another running Claude session (picked from
 * any workspace). maiTerm FORKS that session (`claude --resume <id> --fork-session`)
 * into a fresh split pane beside the caller — an isolated peer with the target's
 * full context. The two agents then converse asynchronously via the
 * `sendToBridgedAgent` MCP tool; every message is injected as a real terminal turn
 * in the recipient's pane, so the human watches (and can interrupt with Esc).
 *
 * Identity is stamped by maiTerm (not self-asserted), so the recipient always knows
 * a message is from a peer agent — never confused for the human operator.
 *
 * Handshake (tight + routing-proof): a forked session resumes the target's
 * transcript, which already contains the target's `initSession` — so the fork
 * believes it is already initialized (as the wrong tab) and never re-binds its new
 * MCP connection, leaving its maiTerm tools unusable. So after the fork's Claude
 * comes up we inject a directive forcing it to re-`initSession` as ITS OWN tab. The
 * opener (caller → "introduce yourself") then fires off the fork's real
 * `claude-init-session` event, which proves the fork is up, on THIS instance, and
 * tool-capable — not a flaky `SessionStart` hook.
 *
 * Delivery model: a peer message is injected into the recipient's PTY as a real prompt.
 * Claude Code captures input submitted mid-turn and runs it when the current turn ends,
 * so we deliver in BOTH the active and idle states — the agent gets the info DURING its
 * flow, not only after it stops. We hold back for exactly two cases, queuing until they
 * clear: a permission / multiple-choice prompt awaiting the human (an injected paste+CR
 * would hijack their pick), and an offline/dormant session (don't inject a bare shell).
 * `ready` tracks live-vs-dormant; `busy` is just a short post-injection cooldown that
 * serializes injections (so two pastes can't interleave) and AUTO-clears — it is no
 * longer "waiting for a Stop", so a missed/unresolved Stop can't wedge the queue. A
 * drain poller backstops any message queued while held.
 *
 * Bridges are self-healing: at send time the recipient must still have a live Claude
 * session; if its session id drifted (it resumed) the bridge re-binds rather than
 * breaking, and a closed tab tears the bridge down cleanly.
