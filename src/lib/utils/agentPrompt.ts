 * into a `[Pasted text #N]` / `[Image #N]` chip via ASYNCHRONOUS processing
 * (buffering the text, reading attachment files, re-rendering the placeholder). A
 * CR that arrives before that settles is swallowed — the prompt stages in the
 * input but never submits. A short typed line has nothing to buffer and settles
 * instantly, which is why small prompts always submitted but big pastes, image
 * sends, and 20-line agent-bridge replies didn't.
 *
 * There's no readable "paste settled" signal from the TUI, so we scale a delay
 * with payload size (and attachment count) and cap it. Empirical, not exact — if
 * a very large paste ever still fails to submit, widen this.
