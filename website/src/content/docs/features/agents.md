title: Agent Integration
description: One runtime-neutral pipeline that wires Claude Code and OpenAI Codex into maiTerm — IDE tools, live agent state, auto-resume, and bridging.
---

maiTerm integrates deeply with coding agents — **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex** — through a single runtime-neutral pipeline. Both connect to the same MCP/IDE server, drive the same live agent-state indicators, auto-resume after a restart, pair through [Agent Bridge](/features/agent-bridge/), and send notifications — all without a manual setup step. maiTerm detects which agent connected from its own identity, so the right integration just lights up the moment you run `claude` or `codex`.

## Supported agents

| Agent | On by default | Integration |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | Yes | MCP/IDE tools, hooks, auto-resume, Agent Bridge (fork or connect), SSH bridge, `/maiterm` skill + status line |
| **Codex** | Yes | MCP/IDE tools, lifecycle hooks, auto-resume, Agent Bridge (connect existing tab), SSH bridge, `maiterm` prompt |

Both agents get the same core treatment: live state in the sidebar and footer, tab activity indicators, auto-resume after a crash or relaunch, and notifications — all driven through the same hooks pipeline. Integration is on by default for each; it only takes effect once you actually run that agent.

## How It Works

```
Claude Code / Codex CLI ←→ Streamable HTTP ←→ axum server (Rust) ←→ Tauri events ←→ Frontend (Svelte)
```

There's **one** MCP/IDE server, shared by every agent. It starts automatically when maiTerm launches and listens on a single port with a single auth token. What differs per agent is only the on-disk config a CLI reads to discover it:

- **Claude Code** — a lock file in `~/.claude/ide/`, an `mcpServers` entry in `~/.claude.json`, and lifecycle hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **Codex** — an MCP block in `~/.codex/config.toml`, lifecycle hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json`, and a `maiterm` prompt in `~/.codex/prompts/`.

When an agent connects, maiTerm identifies the runtime from the client's own handshake — so a Codex connection never binds to a Claude tab, and **Codex needs no manual `/maiterm init`**: the runtime is recognized from how it connected.

## Choosing your agents

Agent settings live in one runtime-neutral **AI Agents** section in Preferences, with a subsection per agent. Toggling an agent on or off installs or removes its integration immediately — no restart required.

**Claude Code**

- **Enable IDE Integration** — the MCP/IDE server and tools
- **Enable Hooks Integration** — lifecycle hooks for real-time state
- **Enable Auto-Resume via Hooks** — capture session IDs and reconnect on restore
- **Enable IDE Integration over SSH** — expose IDE tools to remote Claude Code via reverse tunnel

**Codex**

- **Enable Codex IDE integration** — the MCP/IDE server and tools for Codex
- **Codex lifecycle hooks** — the 7 Codex hook events that drive state and auto-resume
- **Codex auto-resume** — capture session IDs and reconnect on restore
- **Codex MCP bridge over SSH** — expose IDE tools to remote Codex
- **Skip the one-time Codex hook-trust prompt** *(advanced)* — the only agent toggle off by default; Codex's one-time hook-trust approval is deliberately kept unless you opt out

### SSH MCP Bridge

When you're SSH'd into a remote server, maiTerm bridges the MCP connection so an agent running remotely still has access to all IDE tools. A reverse SSH tunnel is set up automatically in the background — no manual port forwarding needed. For each enabled agent maiTerm writes the matching remote config (Claude Code's lock file and `~/.claude.json`, or Codex's `~/.codex/config.toml` and `hooks.json`), gracefully no-op'ing on a host that doesn't have that CLI installed. The bridge status is shown in the tab bar with a bolt icon (green = connected).

See [Agent Bridge](/features/agent-bridge/) for the full feature.

### Tab Context Discovery

The `getTabContext` tool lets your agent peek at what's happening in your tabs — recent terminal output or editor file content. If you have fewer than 10 tabs, it automatically returns context for all of them, making it easy for the agent to find the right tab without you having to specify. For larger workspaces, you can pass specific tab IDs.

## Agent Hooks

maiTerm integrates with each agent's hook system for real-time session awareness — no regex triggers needed. Claude Code's hooks are registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`; Codex's lifecycle events are registered in `~/.codex/hooks.json`. Both feed the same pipeline:

- **Session lifecycle** — tracks session start, end, and compaction events
- **Active tool overlay** — see what the agent is doing right now (editing files, running bash, etc.) in the terminal corner
- **Agent state indicators** — per-tab, per-workspace, and a global footer dot show whether each agent is working, waiting for permission, or done — see [Agent State Indicators](#agent-state-indicators) below
- **Auto-resume** — automatically captures session IDs and reconnects on tab restore (see [Auto-resume](#auto-resume) below)
- **Multi-agent awareness** — `getClaudeSessions` lets any session discover other active agent sessions across tabs for coordination, and [Agent Bridge](/features/agent-bridge/) lets two sessions talk to each other directly
- **Compaction notifications** — alerts during and after context compaction

## Agent State Indicators

maiTerm surfaces what every agent is doing at three levels, all driven by hooks — no terminal-output guessing:

- **Per tab** — each tab's indicator reflects its agent: a pulse while working, ❗ when it needs permission, and a green dot when it's done and waiting for input. Ordinary terminal output stays a dim dot, so a finished agent is never mistaken for a stray line of output.
- **Per workspace** — the sidebar rolls a workspace's tabs into one dot using batch semantics (`permission > working > done`). It turns green only once *every* agent in the workspace has settled, so green unambiguously means "all done."
- **Global footer dot** — rolls up every agent in the current window: red pulse = needs permission, accent pulse = working, green = finished, dim = no agents. Click it to jump straight to an agent's tab; when several agents share the dominant state, each click cycles to the next.

### Read vs. unread

A finished agent shows a **filled** green dot (unread); once you view its tab it relaxes to a **hollow** green ring (seen). This rolls up too — a workspace dot stays filled until every finished agent inside it has been seen, then goes hollow — so you can tell at a glance which completed agents still need a look.

## Auto-resume

When an agent registers, maiTerm captures its session ID and arms auto-resume so a restored or relaunched tab reconnects to the same conversation. Auto-resume is **runtime-aware**: the resume modal preselects the right command for whichever agent is running — `claude --resume …` for Claude Code, `codex resume …` for Codex — and hides itself entirely when a tab has no agent.

## Agent Bridge

Bridge two running agent sessions so they can collaborate directly — one local and one over SSH, two related projects, even a Claude Code and a Codex. Press `Cmd+Shift+L` to pick a peer session; maiTerm forks it into a split pane beside you (when the target supports forking) or links an existing tab, and the two agents talk through `sendToBridgedAgent`. Every message is stamped with the sender's real identity so the recipient knows it's a peer, not you — and the agents stay deferring to you for decisions. Bridges persist across restarts.

See the dedicated [Agent Bridge](/features/agent-bridge/) page for the full walkthrough. To scale past a single pair to a whole roster of agents that can each address any other by role — with topics, loop control, and a cockpit — see [Mesh Workspace](/features/mesh-workspace/), the N:M generalization of a bridge.

## File Drop & Image Paste

Drag files onto a terminal running an agent over SSH — maiTerm SCP uploads them to a temp directory on the remote and pastes the paths so the agent can read them as file references. On local terminals, file paths are pasted directly.

You can also paste images from your clipboard (Cmd+V) into an agent session. maiTerm saves the image to a temp file and pastes the path, so the agent can view it directly — useful for sharing screenshots, diagrams, or error messages without leaving the terminal.

## The `/maiterm` Skill

For Claude Code, maiTerm installs a skill that gives your agent fast slash-command access to the most common tools — `/maiterm notes`, `/maiterm tabs`, `/maiterm diag`, and more — without making it hunt through every MCP tool. It's written on launch and removed on exit, and it works the same way over SSH on bridged remote hosts. Codex gets an equivalent `maiterm` prompt written to `~/.codex/prompts/`.

It also ships a recommended **status line** for Claude Code. Run `/maiterm statusline` and your agent installs a compact status line showing host · cwd · git branch · model · reasoning effort · context usage. The installer renders a live colored preview first, only writes to `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` and your settings (it's idempotent — safe to re-run), and tells you if `jq` is missing instead of leaving a broken line. It works on local sessions and on SSH-bridged hosts.

## Dev/Production Isolation

Dev builds register as `maiterm-dev` (with display name "maiTermDev"), so development and production instances don't interfere with each other.
