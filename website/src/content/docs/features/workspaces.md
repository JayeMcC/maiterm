## Workspaces

Group your terminals by project. Each workspace has its own pane layout, tabs, and context. Switch between "ACME Project" and "Production Server" without losing your place in either.

### Features

- **Named workspaces** — organize by project, client, or however you work
- **Independent layouts** — each workspace has its own split pane tree
- **Drag and drop** — reorder workspaces in the sidebar
- **Sort options** — default (manual), alphabetical, or recent activity
- **Tab count** — optional display of tab count after workspace names
- **Recent workspaces** — collapsible section, toggleable in preferences
- **Workspace notes** — markdown notes scoped to the whole workspace
- **Suspend & resume** — suspend inactive workspaces to free resources (PTYs are killed, memory released). Resuming brings back exactly the tabs that had a live terminal when you suspended — maiTerm respawns and auto-resumes just those (with a progress modal for larger resumes), so a 20-tab workspace that had 3 agents running comes back with those 3 live, without waking tabs you never started. Auto-suspend after configurable timeout (15/30/60 min)
- **Full-session restore on relaunch** — on launch, maiTerm respawns and auto-resumes every tab that was live at last shutdown, across *every* workspace — one at a time, with a cancellable progress modal — so an agent in another workspace is already picking up where it left off when you switch to it. A window *reload* reattaches to terminals that are still running instead of respawning them
- **Multi-window** — open additional windows with independent workspace layouts; window positions remembered per monitor configuration

## Panes

Panes are the containers within a workspace. Each pane holds one or more tabs (terminal, editor, or diff).

### Split Panes

- **Horizontal and vertical splits** — create any layout you need
- **Drag to resize** — adjust split ratios by dragging the divider
- **Recursive splits** — splits within splits for complex layouts
- **Terminal persistence** — terminals survive split tree changes via the portal pattern

### Per-Tab Notes

Each tab has its own markdown notes panel. Track TODOs, paste connection strings, jot down what you're debugging — right next to the terminal doing the work.

Your coding agent — Claude Code or Codex — shares the same panel. Ask it to write down what it just did, keep a running TODO list, or summarize a debugging session, and it edits the notes directly through MCP tools — no copy-paste. It can read, write, update, organize, merge, and clean up both tab and workspace notes, so your notes stay current while you work.

- **Markdown or plain text** — your choice per tab
- **Agent-maintained** — ask your agent to write, update, and tidy your notes via MCP tools
- **Interactive checkboxes** — rendered in preview mode
- **Editable tables** — click any table cell in preview mode to edit it in place; `Tab` moves between cells
- **Edit and preview modes** — state persisted per tab
- **Configurable** — font size, font family, panel width
